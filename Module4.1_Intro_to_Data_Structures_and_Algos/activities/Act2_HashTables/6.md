### Open Addressing

The **open addressing** method has all the hash keys stored in a fixed length table. With this method a hash collision is resolved by **probing**, or searching through alternate locations in the array (the *probe sequence*) until either the target record is found, or an unused array slot is found, which indicates that there is no such key in the table. We use a hash function to determine the base address of a key and then use a specific rule to handle a collision. Each location in the table is either empty, occupied or deleted. 
- **Empty** is the default state of all spaces in the table before any data is ever stored.
- **Occupied** means that there is currently a key-value pair stored in the location. 
- **Deleted** means there was once a value stored in the space, but it has been marked deleted. Although deleted positions are treated the same as empty positions for the insert operations, those deleted positions are treated as occupied when doing data retrieval.


Below are the basic process of inserting a new key (*k*) using open addressing:

1. Compute the position in the table where *k* should be stored.

2. If the position is empty or deleted, store *k* in that position.

3. If the position is occupied, compute an alternative position based on some defined hash function.

The alternative position can be calculated using: 

- **linear probing:** distance between probes is constant (i.e. 1, when probe examines consequent slots);
- **quadratic probing:** distance between probes increases by certain constant at each step (in this case distance to the first slot depends on step number quadratically);
- **double hashing:** distance between probes is calculated using another hash function.

> A probe is simply the distance from your the current position that is being search to the previous position.


### Linear Probing

By systematically visiting each slot one at a time, we are performing an open addressing technique called **linear probing**. When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new key to a cell of the hash table that is already occupied by another key, linear probing searches the table for the closest following free location and inserts the new key there. Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table sequentially starting at the position given by the hash function, until finding a cell with a matching key or an empty cell. 

Considering the interval between successive probes is fixed (usually to 1), let’s assume that the hashed index for a particular entry is **index**. The probing sequence for linear probing will be:

index = index % hashTableSize
index = (index + 1) % hashTableSize
index = (index + 2) % hashTableSize
index = (index + 3) % hashTableSize 

and so on...

### Quadratic Probing

A variation of the linear probing idea is called **quadratic probing**. Instead of using a constant “skip” value, we use a rehash function that increments the hash value by 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on. This means that if the first hash value is *h*, the successive values are ℎ+1, ℎ+4, ℎ+9, ℎ+16, and so on. In other words, quadratic probing uses a skip consisting of successive perfect squares.

Let us assume that the hashed index for an entry is **index** and at **index** there is an occupied slot. The probe sequence will be as follows:

index = index % hashTableSize
index = (index + 12) % hashTableSize
index = (index + 22) % hashTableSize
index = (index + 32) % hashTableSize

and so on...

### Double Hashing

Double hashing is similar to linear probing and the only difference is the interval between successive probes. Here, the interval between probes is computed by using two hash functions.

Let us say that the hashed index for an entry record is an index that is computed by one hashing function and the slot at that index is already occupied. You must start traversing in a specific probing sequence to look for an unoccupied slot. The probing sequence will be:

index = (index + 1 * indexH) % hashTableSize;
index = (index + 2 * indexH) % hashTableSize;

and so on…

It uses one hash value as an index into the table and then repeatedly steps forward an interval until the desired value is located, an empty location is reached, or the entire table has been searched; but this interval is set by a second, independent hash function. Unlike the alternative collision-resolution methods of linear probing and quadratic probing, the interval depends on the data, so that values mapping to the same location have different bucket sequences; this minimizes repeated collisions.
