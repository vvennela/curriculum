A Queue is a simple data structure concept that can be easily applied in our day to day life, like when you stand in a line to buy coffee at Starbucks. Let's make a few observations based on this example:

1. People enter the line from one end and leave at the other end
2. The person to arrive first leaves first and the person to arrive last leaves last
3. Once all the people are served, there are none left waiting to leave the line

### Queues in Python

Now, letâ€™s look at the above points programmatically:

1. Queues are open from both ends meaning elements are added from the back and removed from the front
2. The element to be added first is removed first (First In First Out - FIFO)
3. If all the elements are removed, then the queue is empty and if you try to remove elements from an empty queue, a warning or an error message is thrown.
4. If the queue is full and you add more elements to the queue, a warning or error message must be thrown.
