### Implementing a queue

When implementing a queue, here are a couple points to remember:

1. The points of entry and exit are different in a Queue.
2. Enqueue - Adding an element to a Queue
3. Dequeue - Removing an element from a Queue
4. Front - The 1st element of the Queue that was enqueued 1st
5. Rear - The last element of the Queue that was enqueued last
6. Random access is not allowed - you cannot add or remove an element from the middle.
