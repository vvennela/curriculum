`deque` is a library which, when imported, provides ready-made commands such as the `append()` command for enqueuing and the `popleft()` command for dequeuing. However, a deque is a double-ended queue. This means that insertions and deletions can occur at *either* end. This library also includes the functions `appendleft()` and `pop()` which will insert values from the left end and delete values from the right end respectively. `index()` looks for the specific value that's in our Queue and `remove()` takes a specfifc value to remove from the Queue itself.

`Deque` has a lot of functionality and we should now learn to make use of them! 

1. First we have to import the collection! 
```python
from collections import deque

2. Now if we were to create a queue... 
```python
# Creating a Queue
queue = deque([1,5,8,9])

3. If we wanted to append items to our queue...
```python 
# Enqueuing elements to the Queue
queue.append(7) #[1,5,8,9,7]
queue.append(0) #[1,5,8,9,7,0]

4. If we wanted to deque elements...
````python

# Dequeuing elements from the Queue
queue.popleft() #[5,8,9,7,0]
queue.popleft() #[8,7,9,0]

5. If we wanted to display all our elements in the Queue...
```python 
#Printing the elements of the Queue
print(queue)
```

Try using the *popleft()* command after the queue is empty and see what you get. Post the ways in which you can handle this issue.
