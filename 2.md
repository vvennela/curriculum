## Introduction to JavaScript

JS is written by inserting a "script" tag into the HTML webpage as shown here:

<head>
  <body>
    <script>
    </script>
  </body>
</head>

<head>
  <body>
    <script>
    </script>
  </body>
</head>


The script tag can be placed in either the header tag or the body tag. 

Now that you know how JavaScript looks like internally on the webpage, let's create the classic Hello World function in Java Script using the document.write() function. 

<head>
  <body>
    <script>
      document.write("Hello World!");
    </script>
  </body>
</head>

**Always** remember to add semicolons at the end of each line because that's how the script knows to end reading the line. 



<head>
  <body>
    <script>
      document.write("Hello World!");
    </script>
  </body>
</head>
