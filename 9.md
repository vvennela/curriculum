## Break

Break statements forces the loop to stop iterating and forces the code onto the next line of text. Here's what a break statement would look like: 

``` js
  let buttontext = "";
	let i;
	for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  	if (i === 3) { break; }
  	buttontext += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
document.write(buttontext)
```


Instead of printing all nine numbers, the code will print this: 

`The number is 0
The number is 1
The number is 2`

Because it will `break` when `i===3` and will skip past any of the remaining code.
