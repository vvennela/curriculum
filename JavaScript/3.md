# Using Variables in JS

## Naming Variables

Variables in programming are used to contain values. In the following script, we're going to print x. 

You can use two key words which both essentially function the same to create a variable. Either "var" or "let"

<script>
  var x = 50;
  document.write(x);    
</script>

<script>
  let x = 50;
  document.write(x);    
</script>

Both would print "50."

Just like most programming languages, the "=" doesn't strictly mean "equals to" but rather is the assignment operator. 

You can call the variable with just the variable name, which would "contain" value. We call the variable when we do `document.write(x)`

In the above script, we have assigned x a value of 50. If we did the following script, what value would we get? 

<script>
  var x = 50;
  var y = 30; 
  var x = y;
  document.write(x);
</script>

Our output would be 30. 

This is because we "assign" x to be 50 and y to be 30. Then, we "assign" x the value of y, changing it to 30. Unlike math, variables are going to be changed often. 

In JS, the variables are case sensitive. This means that the following code will result in an error. 

<script>
  var x = 50;
  document.write(X);    
</script>

## What can variables hold? 

Variables can hold the following:

## Naming guidelines

There is a guideline when setting JS variables: 

- the first character must be a letter, an underscore(_), or a dollar sign($). The rest of the characters can be letters, numbers, underscores and dollar signs. 
- numbers cannot be the first character
- variables cannot include logical operators or keywords, for instance "x+y" cannot be a variable
- names may not have spaces

These are the reserved keywords:
