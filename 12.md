## Arrow Functions

ES6 introduced "Arrow Functions", which make using functions easier. 

Here's the "Hello World!" as how we did it earlier

``` JavaScript
document.write("Hello World!");
```

And here's "Hello World!" using a function

``` javascript
  hello = function(){
    return "Hello World!"
  }
```

And here's "Hello World" using an Arrow Function

``` JavaScript
  hello = () => "Hello World!"
```


Notice that the function got shorter. If the function has one value and has a return function, we can omit the `function` and `return` statement all together. 

This provides compactness and clarity to the code. 

Let's write this function as an arrow function:

```javascript
let addition = function (x,y){
  return x+y
}
```
