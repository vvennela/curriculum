# Creating Collections

**Collections** in Postman allow us to organize our HTTP requests which makes it easier to automate our API testing. They also allow the user to quickly edit their requests. Organized collections adhere to the **DRY Principle**:

* **D**on't
* **R**epeat
* **Y**ourself



To create a collection in Postman, click the **+ New Collection** button toward the top of the Postman window:

A new window will pop up that will allow you to name your collection and provide a description. Let's walk through an example of making a collection by creating the Color Changer collection.

#### Color Changer Collection:

We are going to create a collection for our requests for the BitBloxs API.

**Steps:**

* Click **+ New Collection**
* Name the collection **Color Changer**
* Provide any description you think necessary
* Click **Create**

On your collection sidebar, you should see the new collection we just created:

We will be using this collection to learn how to add requests to collections and create documentation for collections.
