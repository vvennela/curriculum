# Generating Documentation

Creating documentation is important when creating any project. The same principle applies to Postman collections. We want to create documentation for our collections for people who might want to use the collections in the future. The documentation will provide the user on the purpose and usage of the collection.

One feature that Postman provides is that it will automatically generate some documentation for a collection. You can then go into the generated documentation and edit it to include more detail. We will be using Postman's Documenter to create documentation for the Color Changer collection.

#### Color Changer Collection:

We will walk through an example of generating documentation for our Color Changer collection. To generate the documentation, click the arrow next to the collection on the collection menu:

Then simply click **View in web**. As you can see, Postman generates some documentation for our Color Changer collection.

However, we want to add more details to our documentation. The easy way to do so would be to:

* Click the **New** button
* Click **API Documentation**
* Click the **Select an existing collection**
* Click **Color Changer**

Once you get to this window, you will notice that Postman provides default questions for you to make you documentation more informative. I recommend answering those questions on your own to make sure you understand the purpose of the Color Changer collection.

After answering those questions, click **Save**. Postman will provide you with a link to the updated documentation.

The automatically generated documentation has a section for each request we made. It provides the name, request URL, and an example response on the right side. However, we want to edit this documentation to provide more details. 

To do so, you must open a certain request on Postman. Then click the small arrow next to the requests name:

Then click **Add a description**. This will allow you to add add detail to each request's documentation using Markdown.



Here is some sample documentation for each request we created. I recommend filling out this documentation for each request, or create your own documentation. Also, note that the request URL is in a generic form; I recommend changing your request URL to a generic form for the documentation, or explain each part of your current URL below. Therefore, the user can easily understand each part of the request URL.
