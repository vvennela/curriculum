# Fourth Request (DELETE):

The last request that we will add to our Color Changer collection is a DELETE request. Our DELETE request will remove the color from the specified box and return it to the uninitialized white state. To create the DELETE request, the process is the same as prior, but this request will be named `Delete color`. Make sure that you indicate we are doing a DELETE request in the dropdown menu in the route bar. The URL for this request will be `{{url}}delete/boxNumber`. Therefore, if you want to delete the color from box 254, the request should look like:

The requests we added to Color Changer are just some of the basic essentials needed to use Postman with your APIs. Postman has many features that allow you to test the functionality of APIs that you can continue to explore.
