<!-- title={Second Request (POST)} -->

# Second Request (POST):

The next request we want to create is a POST request. A POST request will allow us to initialize the color of a white box. To create our POST request, follow the same first 3 steps from the GET request but name this request `Change color` instead.

To change make this request into a POST request, in the route bar, change the drop down menu that defaults to GET to the value **POST**.

To complete our request, we just need to work on the request URL. For the POST request, the generic format of the URL would be `{{url}}change/boxNumber/color`. For `boxNumber`, you can insert the number of the box you want to initialize to a certain color. For `color`, you can insert the color (blue, orange, green, yellow) that you want the box to be initialized to. For example if you want to initialize box 23 to the color green, your request should look like:

If you **Send** that request, you should get a response message saying that you successfully changed the color. However, if you send that same request one more time, you should get an error message. The reason for the error is because you changed the color of the box to green with your first request and therefore can no longer initialize the color of the box, thus resulting in the error. To edit the color of an already initialized box, you need to use our next request.
