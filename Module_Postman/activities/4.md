# First Request (GET):

The first request that we'll be adding to our **Color Changer** collection is a GET request. Here are the steps we must follow to create the GET request and add it to our collection:

* Create a new request in the Color Changer collection
* Name the request `Get all boxes`
* Add API key authentication to this request

To add authentication to our requests, first click the **Authentication** tab in the request window:

Then under **TYPE**, select the option **API Key**. To the right, in the **Key** field, enter api_key. In the **Value** field, enter our variable for our API Key, which is {{api_key}}. For the **Add to** field, ensure that Query Params is selected. Your Authorization window should now look like this:

Now that we've established our credentials, let's create the route. To do so, refer to the route bar:

Make sure that the box on the left reads **GET** because we are making a GET request. In the box that reads `Enter request URL`, let's put our GET request URL, which would be `{{url}}boxes?=&=`. Notice how we are accessing our url variable we established earlier by calling {{url}}. Now if we click **Send**, we should receive a response that lists all the boxes in JSON format, which allows us to see the current status of the BitBloxs. Our GET request is now complete! Make sure to save it by clicking on the **Save** button to the right of **Send**.
