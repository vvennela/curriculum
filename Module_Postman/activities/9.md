# Importing API Collections

Postman has a feature that allows you to import APIs from existing documentation. To demonstrate this feature, we will be using **Cisco DevNet**, which can be found at https://explore.postman.com/team/ciscodevnet. 

On the link above, find **Webex Teams API**. To import this API into Postman, simply click the orange button to the right that says **Run in Postman**. It should open this collection in Postman. To understand the usage of this collection, you can click **View Documentation**.

Since we'll be using the **Webex Teams API**, let's open it in Postman and open the documentation. The API request we are going to use from this collection is the **Create a room (Teams)** POST request, which can be found here:

Since we did not create this collection or API, we obviously do not know how to use the **Create a room** request; therefore, let's refer to the documentation we opened earlier. If we look for this request in the left menu bar, we can easily the find documentation for the request we're working with. Here's what the documentation for this request looks like:

If you look under **HEADERS** you will notice that this request requires an access token to perform this request. To get this access token, you will need to sign up for a Cisco Webex account on the link in the documentation (https://developer.webex.com/endpoint-rooms-post.html). Once you log into your Webex account, it will give you an access token. You simply have to click the copy button on this screen:

Now that you have your access token copied to your clipboard, let's authorize our request in Postman:

Notice how I selected the Authorization Type to be **Bearer Token**. I chose Bearer Token because the documentation indicated that the Authorization type is **Bearer**. 

Now that we've authenticated our request, we can send a **Create a room (Teams)** POST request. From the documentation, you may have noticed that our request data will be in the request Body in JSON format. Therefore, let's go to the **Body** tab in Postman and change the **"title"** of our new room to the value **"Chat Room"**:

Now if we click **Send**, our request should go through and the response should look something like:

There we go! We have now imported an API Collection into our Postman collections and used the documentation to send a request to the Cisco Webex API and received a response.
