# Third Request (PUT):

To edit the color of a box, we will use a PUT request. The steps to creating a PUT request are the same as the previous requests but instead we will indicate in the route bar that it is a PUT request. For the PUT request, you can name it `Edit color`. Our generic request URL will be `{{url}}change/boxNumer/color`. For example, if you want to change the color of box 202 to yellow, this will be your PUT request:

If you send the request, it should successfully change the color of box 202 to yellow. The case where this PUT request will result in an error is if the box has not been initialized to a color yet. To initialize the color we must use the POST request from our collection.
