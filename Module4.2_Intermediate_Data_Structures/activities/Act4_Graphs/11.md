```python
next_destinations = {node: shortest_paths[node] for node in shortest_paths if node not in visited}
        if not next_destinations:
            return "Route Not Possible"
        # next node is the destination with the lowest weight
        current_node = min(next_destinations, key=lambda k: next_destinations[k][1])
```

> Step 4 from previous slide: When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the *unvisited set*. A visited node will never be checked again.
>
> Here the code checks for if the node is visited or not.

```python
# Work back through destinations in shortest path
    path = []
    while current_node is not None:
        path.append(current_node)
        next_node = shortest_paths[current_node][0]
        current_node = next_node
    # Reverse path
    path = path[::-1]
    return path
```

> Step 5 from previous slide: If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the *unvisited set* is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.
>
> Here we check the node by using a while loop and see if it is none or not. If it is not in none, we append it to the list called path.

**Step 6**

```python
print(dijsktra(graph, 'r', 'e'))
```

> We use the comment print to show the graph.

 Output:

``['r', 'a', 'f', 'n', 'e']``

So there we have it, confirmation that the shortest path from X to Y is:

**r -> a -> f -> n -> e**
