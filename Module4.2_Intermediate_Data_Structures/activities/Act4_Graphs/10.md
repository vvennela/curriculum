**Step 5**: Now we need to implement our algorithm.

```python
def dijsktra(graph, initial, end):
    # shortest paths is a dict of nodes
    # whose value is a tuple of (previous node, weight)
    shortest_paths = {initial: (None, 0)}
    current_node = initial
    visited = set()
```

> Here, we initialized the Dijkstra's algorithm function (Step 1 and 2 from the previous slides.) Instead of unvisited set, we use a visited set this time.
>
> for example:
>
> current_node = a
>
> ###### visited set = {}
>
> |          | a         | b         | c         | d         |
> | -------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
> | visited? | unvisited | unvisited | unvisited | unvisited |
> | distance | 0         | ∞         | ∞         | ∞         |



```python
 while current_node != end: # do it recursively, until reach the destination node
        visited.add(current_node) # set current_node as visited
        destinations = graph.edges[current_node]
        weight_to_current_node = shortest_paths[current_node][1] 

        for next_node in destinations:
            weight = graph.weights[(current_node, next_node)] + weight_to_current_node
            if next_node not in shortest_paths:
                shortest_paths[next_node] = (current_node, weight)
            else:
                current_shortest_weight = shortest_paths[next_node][1]
                #If the distance is smaller than what the node already have, we update the distance of the node.
                if current_shortest_weight > weight:
                    shortest_paths[next_node] = (current_node, weight) 
```

> Recall step 3 from previous slide: For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their *tentative* distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated *tentative* distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. 
>
> Step 6 from previous slide: Select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new "current node", and go back to step 3.
>
> Here we made a code that calculates the distance between nodes and comapre the distance with its neighbours. We then append the shortest distance path to a list. Doing so we are repeating the process of both Step 3 and Step 6 form previous slide.
