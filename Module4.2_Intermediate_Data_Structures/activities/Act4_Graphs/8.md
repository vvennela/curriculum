### Travel in Europe (Dijkstra's algorithm real life application)

Let's say we need to find out the shortest path from point r to point e in Europe, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm.
Suppose that any geographical map as a graph. Now locations in the map are our **nodes** in algorithm.
And road between loacations are **edges.** **Weights** of the edges are the distance between those two locations here.

Weâ€™ll start by constructing this graph in Python:

**Step 1:** Create a class called Graph. Use the `__init__()` function to assign values for edges and weights.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Graph():
    def __init__(self):
        """
        self.edges is a dict of all possible next nodes
        e.g. {'r': ['i', 'a', 'b', 'd'], ...}
        self.weights has all the weights between two nodes,
        with the two nodes as a tuple as the key
        e.g. {('r', 'i'): 7, ('r', 'a'): 2, ...}
        """
        self.edges = defaultdict(list)
        self.weights = {}
```

**Step 2:** Create a function inside class Graph, which add directed weighted edges to the graph.

```python
def add_edge(self, from_node, to_node, weight):
    # Note: assumes edges are bi-directional
    self.edges[from_node].append(to_node)
    self.edges[to_node].append(from_node)
    self.weights[(from_node, to_node)] = weight
    self.weights[(to_node, from_node)] = weight
```
