## Graphs

A graph is a collection of *nodes* and *edges* that represents relationships:

- **Nodes** are vertices that correspond to objects.

- **Edges** are the connections between objects.

- The graph edges sometimes have **weights**, which indicate the strength (or some other attribute) of each connection between the nodes

  Graphs provide us with a very useful data structure. They can help us to find structure within our data. With the advent of machine learning and big data, managing and manipulating our data has never been more important. Learning a little bit of graph theory will help us with that.
  
  Note that: Trees is a kind of graph. It is a undirected, connected graph without cycles.

### Python Code:

> In order for this to work, you would need to install the modules `networkx` and `matplotlib`
>
> Open terminal and run the statements `pip3 install networkx` and `pip3 install matplotlib`

NetworkX is a Python library for graphs and networks. Matplotlib is a plotting library in python. With Matplotlib you can generate plots, bar charts, histograms with just a few line of code. We can use Matplotlib to draw graphs.

We can create a Path Graph with linearly connected nodes with the method `path_graph()`. The Python code code uses `matplotlib` and `pyplot` to plot the graph. We will give detailed information on `matplotlib` at a later stage in this activity. For now you can follow this code to print out nodes and edges as well as save your graph to a local image:

```python
import networkx as nx #set shortcut for networkx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #set shortcut for matplotlib.pyplot

G = nx.path_graph(4) #Return a path graph G of 4 nodes linearly connected by 4-1 edges

print("Nodes of graph: ")
print(G.nodes()) #return a list of all the nodes in the graph
print("Edges of graph: ")  #nx.draw(G,with_labels=True)
print(G.edges()) #return a list of all the edges
nx.draw(G) #Draw the graph G with Matplotlib
plt.savefig("path_graph1.png") #save the current figure as "path_graph1.png"
plt.show() # display the graph
```

The created graph is an undirected linearly connected graph, connecting the integer numbers 0 to 3 in their natural order: 

You can use `nx.draw(G,with_labels=True)` to show the labels on the nodes. Note that the direction of the graph doesn't matter.
