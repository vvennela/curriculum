## Directed graphs

Directed graphs have edges with direction. The edges indicate a *one-way* relationship, in that each edge can only be traversed in a single direction. This figure below shows a simple directed graph. Edges are usually represented by arrows pointing in the direction the graph can be traversed.

> The graph can be traversed from vertex **A** to **B**, but not from vertex **B** to **A**.

> Directed Graph



### Python Code:

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

G = nx.DiGraph() #Create an empty directed graph structure with no nodes and no edges.
G.add_edges_from(
    [('A','B'),('B','C'),('C','D'),('D','E')]) #add edges A to B, B to C, C to D, D to E
# cause it's a directed graph the order matters. ('B','A'), will create a edge from B to A 

# set the values to determine nodes' color
val_map = {'A': 1.0,
           'D': 0.5714285714285714,
           'H': 0.0}

values = [val_map.get(node, 0.25) for node in G.nodes()]


```

> Here we inputted the number or edges and stored the values of them into val_map (a dictionary*) We then can use the values in val_map to print out the visualization of the graph by making a values list. * and use the get()* function.

> *A list is created by placing all the items (elements) inside a square bracket [ ], separated by commas.It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string etc.).

> *The get() method  is used with a dictionary. It returns the value for the specified key if key is in dictionary.

```python
# set edge colors and specify the edges you want here
red_edges = [('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C'),('C','D'),('D','E')]
edge_colours = ['black' if not edge in red_edges else 'red'
                for edge in G.edges()]
black_edges = [edge for edge in G.edges() if edge not in red_edges]

# Need to create a layout when doing
# separate calls to draw nodes and edges
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
#draw the nodes of G
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, cmap=plt.get_cmap('jet'), 
                       node_color = values, node_size = 500) 
# draw labels on nodes of G
nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos)
#draw the edges
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, edgelist=red_edges, edge_color='r', arrows=True)
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, edgelist=black_edges, arrows=False)
plt.show()
```

> Here the nx represents the networkx module that we imported in the very beginning. The draw_networkx_nodes, draw_networkx_labels, and draw_networkx_edges are some of the fucntions of the module. They are used to draw out nodes, node labels, and edges on the graph.
