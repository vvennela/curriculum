## Dijkstra's algorithm 

 is used to find the shortest path between *a* and *b* (from nodes to nodes). It picks the unvisited vertex with the low distance, calculates the distance through it to each unvisited neighbor, and updates the neighbor's distance if smaller. It was conceived by computer scientist, Edsger W. Dijkstra, in 1956 and published three years later.

Some characteristics for Dijkstra's algorithm:

- Dijkstra's algorithm works on both directed and undirected graphs

- All edges must have nonnegative weights

- Graph must be connected 

Dijkstra's algorithm will assign some initial distance values and will try to improve them step by step.

##### Initializing the graph:

1. Mark all nodes as unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the *`unvisited set`*.

    **unvisited set = {"a", "b", "c", "d"}**

2. In order to keep track of the total distance from the start node to its destination, we use `distance` to store the current total weight of the smallest path. 

   Assign to every node a tentative distance value, set the distance equal to zero for our initial node(since it's 0  away from the initial node) and  set the distance to infinity for all other nodes. 
   
   Also, set the initial node as current, as we are going to process the initial node first. In this case, we start with node a.
