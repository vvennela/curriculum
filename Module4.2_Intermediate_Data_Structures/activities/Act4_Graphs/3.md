##  Eulerian Path and Eulerian Cycle

A **Path** in a graph is a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges. It's a specific route you take when you traverse the graph.

A **cycle** in a graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

A graph is called Eulerian if it has an Eulerian Cycle and called Semi-Eulerian if it has an Eulerian Path. 

**Eulerian path** is a path that visits every edge exactly once, but you can revisit the vertices. You may start from a vertice and end the path with another vertice.

**Eulerian Cycle** is a Eulerian path that starts and ends at the same vertex.



Note that not all the graph have Eulerian path or Eulerian Cycle.

 The **degree** of a vertex is the number of edges that are incident to the vertex.

Euler found that graph can have **Eulerian cycle** if and only if all vertices have even degree.

If two vertices have odd degree and all other vertices have even degree. Then it have a **Eulerian path**



 Example of a **Eulerian Path**

The graph has a **Eulerian Path** , but there is no **Eulerian Cycle** .  Note that the `A  ` and `C`  have odd degree.

This is an example of a **Eulerian Cycle** . All the vertices have a even degree. Follow the path `C` `A` `B` `C` `D` `E` `C`
