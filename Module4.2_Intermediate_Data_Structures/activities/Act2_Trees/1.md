We are going to learn about tree data structures. In order to do so, it is important that we understand the essential terminology.

#### Tree Terminology:

* **Tree**: Hierarchical structure used to store data elements. Trees have no cycles (connections are one-way and never to previous elements), and are "upside-down" in that the root is at the top and leaves are at the bottom.

* **Node**: Each individual data element of the tree that is linked to other data elements within the tree. Identified by a key.

* **Level**: The number of parent nodes that a given node has. For instance, the root node has 0 parents so it is at Level 0. It's children are at Level 1, grandchildren at Level 2, and so on.

* **Edge**: Link that connects two nodes.

* **Root Node**: The node with highest hierarchical precedence. Each tree can only have one root node.

* **Parent Node**: The predecessor of a node is called its parent. The root node does not have a parent.

* **Child Node**: The descendant of a node is called its child.

* **Sibling Nodes**: The nodes that have the same parent are called siblings.

* **Leaf Nodes**: A node that does not have a child is called a leaf.

* **Internal Nodes**: A node that has at least one child is called an internal node.

* **Subtree**: A grouping of connected nodes within the tree.

In the tree above, the circles with numbers in them are the **nodes** of the tree. The arrows connecting each nodes are the **edges**. The **root** of this tree is the node that contains the number 8. The node containing 3 is a **parent** of the node containing 1. The node containing 1 is a **child** of the node containing 3. The nodes with 4 and 7 are **siblings**. The nodes with 1, 4, 7, and 13 are **leaf** nodes. The nodes containing 8, 3, 10, 6, and 14 are all **internal** nodes. Finally, the group of nodes with values 6, 4, and 7 are a **subtree** of the tree.

#### Real Life Application of Trees:

##### Ancestry Trees:

You may be wondering why we would want to use trees. A real life example of a tree structure being used is in ancestry trees. Think of each person in the family as a node. Every person in the family tree is related to other people in the family in some way as a sibling, parent, grandparent, etc. Tree data structures behave in a very similar way as they are both hierarchical structures with nodes, or family members, connected together in a certain manner, and the connection between nodes are there for a specific reason.
