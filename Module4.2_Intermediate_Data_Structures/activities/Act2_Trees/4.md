Another very useful function when working with BSTs is the ability to add nodes to the tree.

#### BST Insert:

When adding a new node to a BST, we must make sure to find the correct place to insert that node. Let's look at the code for `BSTInsert`:

```Python
def BSTInsert(curNode, newNode):
    if curNode is None:
        curNode = newNode
    else:
        if curNode.key < newNode.val:
            if curNode.right is None:
                curNode.right = newNode
            else:
                BSTInsert(curNode.right, newNode)
        else:
            if curNode.left is None:
                curNode.left = newNode
            else:
                BSTInsert(curNode.left, newNode)
```

`BSTInsert` traverses through the BST in a similar way to `BSTSearch`. However, once it finds that the specific child is null in the place where the new node belongs, it places that node there. Try working and experimenting with the code on your own machine.

To illustrate how this code works, let's use the tree from the first card as as an example. We will add a node `11` to this tree. Below, you can see the specific path that `BSTInsert` takes to insert the node as well as the actual position that `11` ends up in:

##### Time Complexity:

Similarly to `BSTSearch`, the worst-case scenario runtime for `BSTInsert` is also **O(n)**. The worst-case would occur when you have to go through every node in the tree to find the proper place to insert the node.

Let's use the same example from the previous card to illustrate this:

In order to insert `60` into this tree, we needed to visit every other node first. Hence, this was a worst-case scenario.
