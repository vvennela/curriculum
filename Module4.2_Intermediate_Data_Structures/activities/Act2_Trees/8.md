> **For BSTs, make a simple database example, be able to search members by ID**

Now to further **enhance your comprehension for Binary Search Tree's**, we will use a Binary Search Tree in an example **real-world application** in order for you to see the purpose behind this algorithm.

Consider that we are admins for a corporation that has many employees and we must have some sort of way to keep track of each employee in our database system. We need an efficient way of **searching** for particular employees based on their **employee identification number**. Each employee has a distinct identification number, so we will use a Binary Search Tree as our structure that stores the employees' ID numbers which represent the nodes. 

```python
# Python program to demonstrate insert operation in a binary search tree  
  
# A utility class that represents an individual node in a BST 
# We added arguments to the `Node` class initializer function that we will use to let us store the important data we want to store about each employee's ID number(Key) and name.
# For our employee information tree, we weant to hold the **key**, and **name** for each employee of the company.Therefore, we must slightly modify our 'Node' class to allow us to encompass that data.
class Node: 
    def __init__(self,key,name): 
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.val = key
        self.employeeName = name

               
# We are now assigning the name of the employee to be the key that we identify each node as, which is an implementation choice. You could really use any data aspect as the key for each employee. It is just what we will use to identify a certain node.
# A utility function to insert a new node with the given key 
def insert(root,node): 
    if root is None: 
        root = node 
    else: 
        if root.val < node.val: 
            if root.right is None: 
                root.right = node 
            else: 
                insert(root.right, node) 
        else: 
            if root.left is None: 
                root.left = node 
            else: 
                insert(root.left, node) 
  

# Now, we make functions to make a tree in order by the Key value(Employee ID) or the name of employee base on the insert function we produced above. 
# A utility function to do inorder tree traversal 
def inorderID(root): 
    if root: 
        inorderID(root.left) 
        print(root.val) 
        inorderID(root.right)
        
def inorderName(root):
    if root:
        inorderName(root.left)
        print(root.employeeName)
        inorderName(root.right)

# We make a function to search the name of employee base on the Key value(Employee ID).   
# A utility function to search a given key in BST 
def search(root,key): 
      
    # Base Cases: root is null or key is present at root 
    if root is None or root.val == key: 
        print(root.employeeName)
        return root 
  
    # Key is greater than root's key 
    if root.val < key: 
        return search(root.right,key) 
    
    # Key is smaller than root's key 
    return search(root.left,key) 
    
#Now, we declare "Abel" with ID number '50' as a root of the employee tree. Also, there are 6 more employees with different ID numbers. We insert 6 employees under the root node of 'Abel' by using 'insert' function.
r = Node(50, "Abel") 
insert(r,Node(30, "Bob")) 
insert(r,Node(20, "Cathy")) 
insert(r,Node(40, "Debbie")) 
insert(r,Node(70, "Evan")) 
insert(r,Node(60, "Fiona")) 
insert(r,Node(80, "Gabriel")) 


# We have inserted all node objects for the root but we have not made them in order by employee ID or employee name. To do so, we use inorderID or inorderName function. Also, we can search the employee name by the key value(employee ID).
# Print inoder traversal of the BST 
inorderID(r)
inorderName(r)
search(r, 20)
```
