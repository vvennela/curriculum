## Functions

A function in JavaScript is a block of code which is designed to do something. When the function is invoked, the code performs a certain task. In the example below, we want to multiply two numbers. 

``` javascript
  let x = buttonFunction(4, 3);   
function buttonFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;            
}
```


The result will be 12. 

When the code hits the `return`, the code will stop executing. 

The general format for a function is as follows:

`function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3...){`

`code to be executed`

}

Functions are usefull because they can be defined according to our needs and can be used however we see fit. 

Make your own function which adds two numbers!

Answer:

```javascript
let x = buttonAdd(30,50)
function buttonAdd(a,b){
  return a+b;
}
```
