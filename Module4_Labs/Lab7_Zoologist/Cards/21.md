Take a look at the format given in the starter code:

```python
equations = [
        n**2,        # 0
        20n**2+5n+7, # 1
        # 2 insert equation here 
        # 3 insert equation here
        # 4 insert equation here
        # 5 insert equation here
        # 6 insert equation here
        # 7 insert equation here
        # 8 insert equation here
        # 9 insert equation here
        # 10 insert equation here
        # 11 insert equation here
        # 12 insert equation here
        # 13 insert equation here
        # 14 insert equation here
    ]

```

**Step 1** &nbsp;  `Transcribing equations`

Fill in the rest of the rows by transcribing the equations given into python equations. Dont forget to import the necessary **functions** from the **math** module.  

** Step 2 **   &nbsp;  `Prompt for user input`

As for the **prompting** of the user to pick a type of **sorting**, don't forget to use a `while` loop and check if any of the `input` matches exactly what counts as a valid answer.
