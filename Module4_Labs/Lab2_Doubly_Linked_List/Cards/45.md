**Step 1: insertBefore()**

This is the last method for inserting the item, and this item will be inserted before another one in the list. In **insertBefore()**, you will take in two parameters which are the value and the node to be inserted before.

If this is an empty list, you should simply return.

Otherwise, we will iterate through all the nodes in the doubly linked list. In case the node before which we want to insert the new node is not found, just print he message, "Target not Found." and return.

Else if the selected node exists in the list, break out your traversing loop and insert the new node in before the selected node.

Note that you will need to adjust the pointers for both nodes after the insertion. If the node to be inserted before is the head node, what would the previous pointer of the new node be?
