**Step 1: Check for an empty list and set curr**

The function `insertBefore(target, newData)` is very similar to the previous function we did. If we wanted to insert a new node before the node containing the value 17, we would call `insertBefore(17, newData)`.

We start out the same way as `insertAfter`, checking that the list is not empty. We set `curr` to the head of the list. 

```python
def insertBefore(self, target, newData):

		# If the list is empty
  	if self.head == None:
    		return

  	else:
    		curr = self.head
```

**Step 2: Iterating through the list to find the target**

We use the same while loop and if statement as the insert after function as well. We iterate through the linked list by continuously setting `curr` to the node after it, until the data at that node equals the target value. If `curr` is equal to `None`, that means we were not able to find the target in the list, so we exit the method after printing. 

```python
    		# 2. Search for target node
    		while curr.data != target:
      			curr = curr.next
      			if curr == None:
        				print("Target not found.")
        				return
```

**Step 4: Inserting the new node before the target**

Once the data at `curr` equals `target`, we can insert `newData`. We make a node out of that value, and then set the pointers accordingly. First, set `newNode` to point back to the value before `curr`. Then, set `newNode` to point to `curr`. This positions the new node before `curr`. 

```python
				# 3. If target was found, curr != None
      	newNode = Node(newData)
      	newNode.prev = curr.prev
      	newNode.next = curr
```

**Step 5: Pointing to the new node**

Now check to see if we inserted before the head of the list. If not, then we can set the node before `curr` to point to the new node. Otherwise, `newNode` is already at the start of the list, and `newNode.prev` will already point to `None`. If we are at the first node, we will set the new node as `self.head`.

```python
      	# 4. If curr is not the first node
      	if curr.prev != None:
        		curr.prev.next = newNode

        else:
          	self.head = newNode
```

**Step 6: Pointing back at the new node**

The last step in situating the new node is to set the node before `curr` as `newNode`, by making the current node's `prev` point to the new node. Now `newNode` is before `curr`, and after the node that was originally before `curr`.  

Finally, we increment the size of the linked list by one. 

```python
        # 5. Connect the current node with the new node
     		curr.prev = newNode

   # Increment size
   self.size += 1
```

This is the completed code for `insertBefore(self, target, newData)`:

```python
def insertBefore(self, target, newData):

		# If the list is empty
  	if self.head == None:
    		return

  	else:
    		curr = self.head
        
    		# 2. Search for target node
    		while curr.data != target:
      			curr = curr.next
      			if curr == None:
        				print("Target not found.")
        				return
              
				# 3. If target was found, curr != None
      	newNode = Node(newData)
      	newNode.prev = curr.prev
      	newNode.next = curr

      	# 4. If curr is not the first node
      	if curr.prev != None:
        		curr.prev.next = newNode

        else:
          	self.head = newNode
				
        # 5. Connect the current node with the new node
     		curr.prev = newNode

   # Increment size
   self.size += 1
```
