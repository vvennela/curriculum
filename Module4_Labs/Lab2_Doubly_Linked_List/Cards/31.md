**Step 1: search()**

The operation in this card is similar to traversing the doubly linked list, as you need to go through each element in the list and compare the element with your specific value.

In this function, you need to return the boolean value, either `True` or `False`. You can use a while loop and the next pointer to traverse the list until you find the matching node with the specific value or pass the tail node, going out of bounds.
