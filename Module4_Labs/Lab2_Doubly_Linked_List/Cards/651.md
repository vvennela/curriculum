**Step 1: Putting it Together & Final Notes**

With that, our `popBack()` function is complete!

```python
def popBack(self):
    
    # 1. If the list isn't empty
    if self.head == None:
      	return
    
    else:
      	# 2. If there ISN'T only one node
        if self.head != None:
        		self.tail = self.tail.prev
        		self.tail.next = None

        # 3. If there IS only one node
        else:
         	 self.head = None
         	 self.tail = None
		
    # Decrement size
    self.size -= 1
    
```

Overall, you can think of this process as removing the last person in the line. As you can see in the picture below, `self.tail` is the node with the value **1**, let's call this **Node(1)**. `self.tail.next` is None and `self.tail.prev` is  **Node(45)**

In order to delete the last node, you must make `self.tail` the previous node, or else we will lose the address of the previous node.

Now, **Node(45)** is `self.tail`. Since the node is `self.tail`, we can point `self.tail.next` to be None. **Node(1)** is now deleted after we call Python's built in garbage collector because **Node(1)** does not point to anything anymore.
