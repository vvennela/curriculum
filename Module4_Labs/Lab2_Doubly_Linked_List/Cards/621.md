**Step 1: Regular Operation**

Now, if the list is not empty, let's continue coding the removing process.

We can first check if there is more than one node in the list and set `self.head` to the next node. Now that `self.head` is the second node in the list, we can now get get rid of the connection the previous node. 

```python
	else:
    	# 2. If there ISN'T only one node
    	if self.head.next != None:
      		self.head = self.head.next
      		self.head.prev = None
```

**Step 2: Checking the Edge Case**

In the case that there is only one node in the list, we would just make the head and the tail point to `None`.

```python
  		# 3. If there IS only one node
  		else:
        	self.head = None
        	self.tail = None
```
Then, after we remove a node from our list, we have remember to decrease the size of the list.

```python
	# Decrement size
	self.size -= 1
```

**Step 3: Putting it Together**

With that, our `popFront()` function is complete!

```python
def popFront(self):
  
  	# 1. If the list is not empty
  	if self.head == None:
				return
        
	else:
    	# 2. If there ISN'T only one node
    	if self.head.next != None:
      		self.head = self.head.next
      		self.head.prev = None
            
  		# 3. If there IS only one node
  		else:
        	self.head = None
        	self.tail = None
            
     # Decrement size
	self.size -= 1
```
