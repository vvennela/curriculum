Although the keyword `list` in python has a built-in function called `len()` that returns the number of entries in a list, this doesn't work on doubly linked lists. We need to write a function to do the same thing for our doubly linked list.

Define a function called **getSize()** that returns the number of nodes in your doubly linked list.
