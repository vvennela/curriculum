**Step 1: Node class**

For the **Node class**, we should have a constructor that initialize the three member variables: the element (the actual data); next pointer (next node); previous pointer (previous node). These pointers should be pointing at `None` by default because we don't know where this node will be in our list.

**Step 2: DoublyLinkedList class**

For the **DoublyLinkedList class**, the constructor will initialize the first node as `None`.
