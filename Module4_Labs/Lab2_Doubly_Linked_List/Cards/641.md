**Step 1: Regular Operation**

If the list is not empty, let's continue coding the popping process.

Similar to method we used for `popFront()`, we can first check if there is more than one node in the list and set `self.tail` to the previous node. Now that `self.tail` is the second-last node in the list, we can now get get rid of the connection the next node. 

```python
	else:
      	# 2. If there ISN'T only one node
        if self.head != None:
        		self.tail = self.tail.prev
        		self.tail.next = None
```

**Step 2: Checking the Edge Case**

In the case that there is only one node in the list, we would just make the head and the tail point to `None`.

```python
  		# 3. If there IS only one node
  		else:
        	self.head = None
        	self.tail = None
```

Then, after we remove a node from our list, we have remember to decrease the size of the list.

```python
	# Decrement size
	self.size -= 1
```
