**Step 1: Making the node**

The first function that will be made for this class is `push(self, newData)` which adds a new node to the **head** of the list.

We are going to create a new node with any `newData`  that we want and insert it at the `head` of the list.

First, we call the `Node` method to make the incoming data a node that we can add to the linked list.

```python
def push(self, newData):
  	newNode = Node(newData)
```

**Step 2: Pointing to self.head**

The function `push()` relies on `self.head` to keep track of the first node. You can think of this process as cutting to the front of the line. You are the `newNode` and you insert yourself infront of the <u>first</u> person in line. 

Here we're using **dot notation**, which allows us to access and reset variables in the constructor methods of classes. We set our new node to point to the current head of the list by using `.next` from our `Node()` class and `self.head` from our `DoublyLinkedList()` class, where the first node in the list is stored. 

```python
    # newNode -> self.head
  	newNode.next = self.head
```

**Step 3: Pointing back to the new node**

Next, we set `self.head`'s previous pointer to our new node, so now `newNode` is ahead of the value at `self.head`. Again, we use dot notation with `.prev` from the `Node` class. Note that we only do this if the list is **not** empty, since we can't set pointers in an empty list.

```python
    # If the list is not empty
  	if self.head != None:
    		self.head.prev = newNode
```

**Step 4: Pushing to an empty list**

In the case of pushing to an empty list, you can just make the head and the tail the new node. We use dot notation once again, setting `newNode` to both self variables. We need to set both head and tail, so if another method is used on the list afterwards, both can be accessed for adding or removing nodes.

```python
    # If the list is empty
    else:
        self.head = newNode
        self.tail = newNode
```

**Step 5: Finalizing the new head**

The last two steps are crucial for the viability of our linked list. First, we must set the `self.head` pointer to `newNode`, so it becomes the new head of the list. You are now at the **front** of the line, with the `head` pointing at you and the person behind you being `next`. 

**Step 6: Incrementing the list size**

Lastly, we increment the size of the list by one by editing the size variable in our `DoublyLinkedList` class constructor method.

```python
    # The head is now the new node
    self.head = newNode
    self.size += 1
```

Here is a graphic that illustrates the changes in the pointers at the front of the linked list when we call the push method.

Here is the completed code for the `push(self, newData)` method:

```python
def push(self, newData):
  	newNode = Node(newData)
    
    # newNode -> self.head
  	newNode.next = self.head

    # If the list is not empty
  	if self.head != None:
    		self.head.prev = newNode
    
    # If the list is empty
    else:
        self.head = newNode
        self.tail = newNode
		
    # The head is now the new node
    self.head = newNode
    self.size += 1
```
