**Step 1: Normal Operations of push()**

Expanding from the function **push()** which you just defined for inserting the item into an empty list.

You already have the initial coniditon checks in this function. Now, you need to complete the condition when the list is not empty.

If this is not an empty list, then you need to update the pointers of the orignial head node with the new node. Hint: what would happen to the previous pointer of the old head node if you add a new head node into the list, and what about the pointers of the new head node?
