**Step 1: Accessing the `self` Variable**

The `size` function will be very easy to implement since we already have the class variable, `self.size`

Since we will have been keeping track of the count of each node after pushing and popping nodes, all we have to do is return the variable `self.size` for this. 

```python
def getSize(self):
		return self.size
```
