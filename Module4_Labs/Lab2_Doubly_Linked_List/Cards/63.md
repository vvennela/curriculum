**Step 1: pop()**

The last function for removing the element in doubly linked list is **pop()**. This function will take in a value and removes the node that contains that value in the list.

Same procedure here: check whether the list is empty. If yes, then simply return.

Otherwise, traverse the list to find the node that matches the given value. If none of the nodes has the given value, then return the message, "Target not found." If you find the node with the given value, then remove that node from the list.
