**Step 1: pushback()**

Define a function called **pushback()** which will also takes a value as the parameter for initializing the element of new node. Of course, as you might have guessed, we need to check the empty list again! If the list is empty, simply make a new head node with the given value.

Same procedure here, check whether the list is empty. If yes, then simply return.

Otherwise, traverse the list to find the node that match the given value. If no node has the given value, then return the message, "Target not found.".If you find the node with the given value, then remove that node from the list.
