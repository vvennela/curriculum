You can traverse the list to get each element of the node and do something with it, either printing each element in the list or comparing it with a specific value.

Under your doubly linked list class, define a function call **printList()**. It should traverse the list and print each element separated by a comma. The function will take one parameter, which is the node where you want to start printing from. It will print the list from this value to the end of the list. 

Note that for edge cases, like when the list is empty, your code may throw an error. Try using an if statement to check for certain cases before going into the list traversal code.
