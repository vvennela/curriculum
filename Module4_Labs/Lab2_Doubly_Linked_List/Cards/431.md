**Step 1: Making the node**

The next function we will work on is `pushback(self, newData)`

Just like `push(self, newData`), the function `pushback(self, newData)` adds a new node to the list, but it adds it to the **back** or `tail` of the list. It is similar to the `append()` function on a normal list.

Just like in the push method, we first make turn our data into a new node. 

```python
def pushback(self, newData): 
  	
    # Initialize new node
		newNode = Node(newData) 
```

**Step 2: The temp pointer**

The function relies on `self.tail` to keep track of the last node. For this example, you can think of this as going to the back of the line. <u>If the list is not empty</u>, then we have a `temp` pointer pointing to the last node, `self.tail`. We make `temp.next` point to `newNode` and `newNode.prev` point back to temp. This establishes the `next` and `prev` connection between `temp` and `newNode`, so `newNode` is now at the end of the list. Now we just have to set `newNode` as the new tail. 

```python
    # If the list is not empty
    if self.head != None: 
        temp = self.tail
        temp.next = newNode
        newNode.prev = temp
        self.tail = self.tail.next
```

Note the order of setting the values in the body of the if statement. We have to set the temp variable first, so we can manipulate the pointers to and from the original tail of the list, all before setting the new node as the new tail using `self.tail`. 

**Step 4: Pushing to an empty list**

In the case of using `pushback` on an empty list, you just make `newNode` the head and tail. 

**Step 5: Incrementing the list size**

Lastly, we increment the size of the list by one, just like we did with the push function.

```python
    # If the list is empty
    else:
        self.head = newNode 
        self.tail = newNode
        
		# Increment size
    self.size += 1
```

This image depicts how the pointers change when you use the method to add a new tail.

This is the completed code for the `pushback(self, newData)` method:

```python
def pushback(self, newData): 
  	
    # Initialize new node
		newNode = Node(newData) 
		
    # If the list is not empty
    if self.head != None: 
        temp = self.tail
        temp.next = newNode
        newNode.prev = temp
        self.tail = self.tail.next
    
    # If the list is empty
    else:
        self.head = newNode 
        self.tail = newNode
        
		# Increment size
    self.size += 1
```
