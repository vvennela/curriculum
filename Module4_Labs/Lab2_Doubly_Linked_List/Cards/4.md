We will have the following five methods of inserting an item in doubly linked list: 

- insert in an empty list
- insert at the start
- insert at the end
- insert after another item
- insert before another item

These are extremely useful for editing a doubly linked list, because you can add in very specific ways with different methods.

For each method, you will need to write a function that does the specific insertion in the doubly linked list. Remember that all manipulations to the linked list require careful modification of the pointers. A useful tip would be writing a doubly linked list on a piece of paper with proper pointers pointing at specific nodes. As you design the functions, you can erase the original pointing line and draw a new one to see what happens.

Below are the descriptions of each method that you will implement:

**Inserting Items in Empty List**

- Write a function called **push()** that takes in the element you want to insert as the parameter. 
  - Check whether the list is empty.
  - If this is an empty list, insert the new node. Otherwise, you will continue to the next step below, "inserting items at the start."

**Inserting Items at the Start**

- Adding to the **push()** function, if the list is not empty, it should insert the new node as the head of the list. 

**Inserting Items at the End**

- The function **pushback()** will take one element as a parameter.
  - First check if this is an empty list.
  - If not an empty list, insert the new node as the tail of the list.

**Inserting Item After Another Item**

- Define a function called **insertAfter()** which will take two parameters: the value of new node and the node to be inserted after.
  - Yup, check if it's an empty list because you don't want to "insert" after an empty list. 
  - If not an empty list, but the selected node to be inserted after is not found, print the message, "Target not found."
  - Else if the node exists in the list, insert the new node after the selected node.

**Inserting Item Before Another Item**

- Define a function called **insertBefore()** which will take two parameters for the value of new node and the node to be inserted after.
  - Check if it's an empty list.
  - If not an empty list, but the selected node to be inserted after is not found, print the message, "Target not found."
  - Else if the node exists in the list, insert the new node before the selected node.
