**Step 1: popFront()**

Now that we know how to add nodes to the list, let's learn how to *remove* nodes from the list.

First, let's look at how to remove from the **head** of the list. We will be relying on `self.head` since it points to the first node in the list.

This function will be called `popFront()`

```python
def popFront(self):
  
  	# 1. If the list is not empty
  	if self.head == None:
				return
      
    else:
    		# 2. If there ISN'T only onde node
    		if self.head.next != None:
      			self.head = self.head.next
      			self.head.prev = None

      	# 3. If there's only one node
      	else:
            self.head = None
            self.tail = None
    
		# Decrement size
    self.size -= 1
```

For `popFront()`, we will (1) check if the list is empty, then (2) check if there is more than one node in the list and set `self.head` to the next node. Now that `self.head` is the <u>second</u> node in the list, we can now get get rid of the connection the previous node. In the case that there is only one node in the list, we would just make the head and the tail point to `None`.
