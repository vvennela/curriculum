**Step 1: printList()**

The simplest way to check an empty list is to check whether the first node exits. If the first node doesn't exit, meaning that the doubly linked list is empty, then you can return.

Otherwise, the list is not empty, and you should set your current node from the head node to the tail node by using the next pointer.

Print the element of every node you go through.
