**Step 1: Regular Operation**

If the list is not empty, then we shall proceed with the popping process by first searching for the node that we want to pop. Using a while loop, we will traverse through the list with `curr`, and if `curr` reaches the end of the list and equals `None`, then print out "Target not found." and `return` to exit the loop.

```python
		else:
         # 2. Search for target
      	 while curr.data != target:
        		curr = curr.next
            
            if curr == None:
            	print("Target not found.")
                return
```

**Step 2: Putting it Together & Note**

Once we find the target, we check if it's not the last node because the process in deleting a middle node and the last node are different. If the target node is not the last node, then we would create a `temp` pointer to the `next` node and point the node before the target, `curr.prev.next`, to `temp`. Now we can set temp's `prev` pointer to `curr`'s `prev`.

If the target node is the last node, then we can just use our `popBack()` function to remove it from the list.

Note that the order in which the variables are assigned does matter because the values and pointers of the variables, `temp` and `curr` change throughout the if statement. If one is misplaced, then the values may be assigned incorrectly.

```python
        # 3. If curr is not the last node
        if curr.next != None:
          	temp = curr.next
          	curr.prev.next = temp
          	temp.prev = curr.prev

        # 4. If curr is the last node, use popBack()
        else:
            self.popBack()
```

Then, after we remove a node from our list, we have remember to decrease the size of the list.

```python
    # Decrement size
    self.size -= 1
```

---

With that, we have completed our `pop()` function!

```python
def pop(self, target):

	# 1. Check if the list is empty
	if self.head == None:
  		return

		else:
         # 2. Search for target
      	 while curr.data != target:
        		curr = curr.next
            
            if curr == None:
            	print("Target not found.")
                return

    # Decrement size
    self.size -= 1
```
