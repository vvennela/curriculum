**Step 1: pushback()**

Define a function called **pushback()** which will also takes a value as the parameter for initializing the element of new node. Of course, as you might have guessed, we need to check the empty list again! If the list is empty, simply make a new head node with the given value.

If this list already contains some elements, we need to traverse through the list until the tail pointer of the list. The next pointer of the tail will be `None`, so this is your base case to stop your while loop. 

As you come to the last node of the list, simply apply the logic as you insert a new node at the front. However, we are inserting at the end so the pointers adjustment will be a little bit different.
