**step 1:  pop(self, target)**

This next function is going to allow us to delete any node we want from the list, as long as it exists.

```python
def pop(self, target):
    
    # 1. Check if the list is empty
    if self.head == None:
      	return
      
		else:
        # 2. Search for target
      	while curr.data != target:
        		curr = curr.next
            
            if curr == None:
            		print("Target not found.")
                return

        # 3. If curr is not the last node
        if curr.next != None:
          	temp = curr.next
          	curr.prev.next = temp
          	temp.prev = curr.prev

        # 4. If curr is the last node, use popBack()
        else:
            self.popBack()
		
    # Decrement size
    self.size -= 1
```

For `pop(target)`, (1) we will check if the list is empty, then (2) search for the target node. Once we have the target, (3) we check if it's not the last node because the process in deleting a middle node and the last node are different. If the target node is not the last node, then we would create a `temp` pointer to the `next` node and point the node before the target, `curr.prev.next`, to `temp`. Now we can set temp's `prev` pointer to curr's `prev`.
