The function `printList(self, node)` will help you to visualize the list. 

**Step 1: Printing**

We start by printing each node's data value. 

**Step 2: Traversal**

We continue by traversing through the list. It will halt when you reach the end of the list, where `node` equals `None`, since the last node points to `None`. 

```python
def printList(self, node): 
  
		while node != None: 
				print(node.data)
        
        # Get next node
				node = node.next
```

We pass `node` in as a parameter assuming it is the variable assigned to a node from which a linked list was started. Passing in one node is sufficient to traverse the whole list, because we start at this head node, and then access following nodes (`node.next`) since they're linked together.
