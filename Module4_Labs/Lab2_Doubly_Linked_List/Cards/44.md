**Step 1: Empty List Check**

The **insertAfter()** method takes two parameters: the value you want to insert, and the node that you want to insert it after. We can not insert a node after another node if the list contains no nodes, and this is again why we need the empty list check!

If the list is empty, you can return.

**Step 2: Traversal**

Otherwise, you will do something similar to **pushback()** where you traverse the list until you find the node that you want to insert the value after. 

**Step 3: Pointers and Insertion**

If you don't find the node after the tail node, you should insert the new node into the tail node.

Else if the node exists in the list, insert the new node after the selected node. To do this, you need to adjust the next and previous pointers to the new node, the node (A) that it'll be inserted after, and the node after the node A.

Make sure your pointers are set up properly because this is the key to this function.
