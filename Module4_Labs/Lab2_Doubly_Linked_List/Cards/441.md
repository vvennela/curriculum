**Step 1: Check for an empty list**

We learned how to insert at the front and back of the list, but what about the middle? Or after a certain value?

This next function, `insertAfter(target, newData)` will allow us to do just that. `target` is the node you want to insert after, and `newData` will be the new node proceeding `target`. If we wanted to insert a new node after the node containing the value 17, we would call `insertAfter(17, newData)`.

First, we will check if the list is empty. 

**Step 2: Setting up the curr variable**

If it's not, then we set a variable `curr` to the head (first node) of the list, which we will later use to find the target. 

```python
def insertAfter(self, target, newData):
  
		# 1. If the list is empty
  	if self.head == None:
        return
    
    else:
    		curr = self.head
```

**Step 3: Iterating through the list to find the target**

Next, we use a while loop to iterate through the linked list in search of the target value. So long as the value at `curr` is not the value of the target, we set `curr` to the following node using `next` and dot notation. Once the data at `curr` is equal to `target`, we exit the while loop. If we get to the end of the list and we haven't found the target, then `curr` will equal None in the last iteration of the while loop. The if statement will then be evaluated, and we will exit the method.

```python
    		# 2. Search for target node
    		while curr.data != target:
      			curr = curr.next
            
            if curr == None:
            		print("Target not found.")
                return
```

**Step 4: Inserting the new node after the target**

If `target` is found, we skip the if statement, initialize a `newNode` with the `newData` and establish connections for `next` and `prev` between the new node and `curr`. We have to first set the new node to point back at `curr`, and then set `newNode` to point towards the node after `curr`. 

```python
    		# 3. If target was found, curr != None
        newNode = Node(newData)
        newNode.prev = curr
        newNode.next = curr.next
```

**Step 5: Pointing back at the new node**

Now check that the new node is not the last node in the list. If it's not, then we set the node after `curr` to point back at `newNode`. If we inserted after the last node in the list, `newNode.next` will already point to `None`, so we can just set the new node as `self.tail`, shown in the else statement. 

```python
        # 4. If curr is not the last node
        if curr.next is not None:
          	curr.next.prev = newNode

        else:
            self.tail = newNode
```

**Step 6: Pointing towards the new node**

To finalize the position of `newNode`, we set `curr` to point to `newNode`, which completes the connection between `newNode` and the values before and after it. 

Lastly, we increment `self.size` by 1 to track the addition of the new node.

```python
         # 5. Connect the current node with the new node
         curr.next = newNode

    # Increment size
    self.size += 1
```

Here is the complete code for `insertAfter(self, target, newData)`:

```python
def insertAfter(self, target, newData):
  
		# 1. If the list is empty
  	if self.head == None:
        return
    
    else:
    		curr = self.head

    		# 2. Search for target node
    		while curr.data != target:
      			curr = curr.next
            
            if curr == None:
            		print("Target not found.")
                return

    		# 3. If target was found, curr != None
        newNode = Node(newData)
        newNode.prev = curr
        newNode.next = curr.next

        # 4. If curr is not the last node
        if curr.next is not None:
          	curr.next.prev = newNode

        else:
            self.tail = newNode
            
         # 5. Connect the current node with the new node
         curr.next = newNode

    # Increment size
    self.size += 1
```
