**Step 1: What You Are Given**

In order to access the maze from the maze file, you are given the following function:

```python
def readMazeFromFile(f):
      maze = list()
      with open(f) as file:
      for line in file:
           maze.append(list(line.rstrip()))
      return maze
```
**Step 2: Breaking Down readMazeFromFile(f)**

We start by constructing a list type object with the name maze. This will be where we store the contents of the maze file. For the purposes of this lab, this list is essentially an array and we will refer to it as such from here on.

```python
 maze = list()
```

Next, we will need to access the contents of the maze file, which we can do by designating the file we want to open with the following code:

```python
with open(f) as file:
```

Now that we have designated the function argument f as the file we want to open, we run a for loop in which we iterate over each line in our maze file f.

```python
for line in file:
```

We add whatever is on each line of our maze file as an element of our maze array, making sure to strip each line of whitespace using line.rstrip()

```python
maze.append(list(line.rstrip()))
```

Finally we return the contents of the list maze to end the function call.

```python
return maze
```
**Step 3: Using What We Know**

By looking at how the maze file is read, we now know that any maze is represented as a 2D array of characters.

We can simply loop through this 2D array of characters until the letter 's' (start coordinates) is found. We can then return that tuple of start coordinates wherever our 's' is.
