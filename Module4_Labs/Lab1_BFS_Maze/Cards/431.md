Here is the code continued from previous parts:

```python
while len(queue) != 0:   
    # ... rest of while loop code
 
    else:        
        # next 2 lines from last hint
        path = queue.pop(0)   
        last = path[-1] 
```



We first do a simple equality check if the last coordinate is indeed the end coordinates. If that is the case, then our current path is indeed one of the shortest possible paths, and we return the current path.

```python
        if last == end:        
            return path  
```



Then we check if the last coordinate has already been visited, in other words if `last` is in our set `visited`. 

```python
		elif last not in visited: 
```



If we have not visited the last coordinate in this path yet, we iterate through all its neighbors, and for each neighbor we append the neighbor to the existing path and add it to the queue. The method `getAdjacentSpaces()` allows us to very simply iterate through all the neighbors. Lastly, we add the last coordinate to your data structure containing all the visited coordinates. 

```python
			for adjacentSpace in getAdjacentSpaces(maze, last, visited): 
        		# iterate through neighbors
                newPath = list(path) # to use append function  
                newPath.append(adjacentSpace)
                queue.append(newPath)  
                visited.add(last) # add last coordinate to visited
return None
```
Let's see what the `newPath` variable is doing. We first copy the current `path` variable into `newPath` and afterwards we append the newly found `adjacentSpace` into this `newPath` variable. Thus from doing this we have actually created a new path that we would like to traverse in the next iteration. Therefore we would want to add this `newPath` for processing by adding it to the `queue`.

## Code in Python

```python
while len(queue) != 0:   
    # ... rest of while loop code
 
    else:        
        # next 2 lines from last hint
        path = queue.pop(0)   
        last = path[-1]    
        if last == end:        
            return path   
        elif last not in visited:      
            for adjacentSpace in getAdjacentSpaces(maze, last, visited): # iterate through neighbors
                newPath = list(path) # to use append function  
                newPath.append(adjacentSpace)
                queue.append(newPath)  
                visited.add(last) # add last coordinate to visited
return None
```
