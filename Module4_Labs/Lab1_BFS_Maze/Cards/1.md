For this lab you will be coding a breadth-first search algorithm for navigating a maze. We have provided most of the code necessary to make this maze program possible.

There are 8 different "mazes" stored in .txt files, and functionalities for loading a maze from a .txt file and printing the maze and path have already been provided. In addition, a`main()` function is provided. All of this code should be left untouched. 

You will be computing the shortest path using BFS. To do this, you will first program `findStart()` and `findEnd()`, which finds the start and end coordinates given a maze text file. Then you will program a function that finds the neighbors of any space given its coordinates and a maze. This will all come in handy when you make a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path in the `BFS()` function. 

Before starting, we recommend you open the maze text files to get a feel for the formatting of the maze. Asterisks (*) represent walls, the letter 's' is the start and the letter 'e' is the end. Dots ('.') represent possible maze paths. 


| Symbol | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| s      | start   |
| e      | end     |
| .      | paths   |
| *      | Walls   |

Please start off with `findStart()`. This method should accept a predefined maze text file and then return the start coordinates of any maze in tuple form. Maze text files are provided.
