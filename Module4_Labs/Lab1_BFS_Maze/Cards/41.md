To start off, what data structures will you need to initialize for BFS? Remember, a BFS is a "breadth-first search" meaning that every space surrounding the current space should be searched before any other spaces in the maze. There are two data structure we need: one for keeping track of the coordinates to be searched, and one for the coordinates already visited.

Reminder: you are able to generate the available neighboring spaces with the `getAdjacentSpaces()` method. This will be useful to determine which coordinates to search in each iteration.
