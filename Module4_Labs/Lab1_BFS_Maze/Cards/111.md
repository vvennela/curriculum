**Step 1: Iterating through the 2D array**

To iterate through a 2D array, we will have to use nested for loops and the `range` function to determine the number of iterations needed:

```python
for i in range(len(maze)): # len(maze) is the length of a row    
    for j in range(len(maze[0])): # len(maze[0]) is the length of a column - always uniform
```

We need to use a nested `for` loop because of the fact that our maze is made out of a 2D array, we have to firstly loop through each row and then we go through each element in each row. 

Reminder how the `range` function works

```python 
for i in range(n):
    print(i)
```

`i` will take the values of `[0,1,2, ... , n-1]`

**Step 2: Finding the letter `s`**

Within these nested for loops, we check if each maze 'cell' is equal to the letter 's', if so we return the tuple([i, j]): 

```python
        if maze[i][j] == 's':    
            return tuple([i, j])
```

Once we found the letter 's' then we have found the starting tuple and we can terminate the function. We do so by returning the tuple and the function will terminate.
