##### Step 1: Setup

We'll keep track of a list `final` to store the final neighbors to be returned. 

We then iterate through the list of neighboring spaces. 

```
final = list()
for i in spaces: 
```

##### Step 2: Check for Walls

We first check if the space is a wall by indexing the maze at the given coordinates `i[0]` and `i[1]` and see if that character is equal to `'*'`. 

##### Step 3: Check if Visited

Then we also check if the space `i` has been visited already. We can do this by using a list called `visited` and adding all visited spaces to it as they are encountered. If it has not been visited, we append the neighbor to `final`.

```python
# for loop above
    if maze[i[0]][i[1]] != '*' and i not in visited:     
        final.append(i)
    return final
```
