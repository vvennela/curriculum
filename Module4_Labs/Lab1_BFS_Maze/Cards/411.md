Here is the entire BFS pseudocode for your reference: (this will be available on every Easy card)

```pseudocode
initialize a queue Q with start # this section covers this line
initialize a set V tracking visited spaces # this section covers this line

  while Q is not empty:
    path = Q.pop()
    last = last node in path

    if last == end
      return path
    else if last is not in V
      for all spaces adjacent to last but not in V do
        newPath = array(path)
        newPath.append(adjacentSpace)
        add newPath to the queue
      V.add(last)
    return null
```

We use a queue to keep track of the paths that will be searched. This queue is always initialized with just the start coordinates as our starting point. The reason being is that a queue is a "first in first out" data structureâ€” whatever space we put in the queue, we are guaranteed it will be considered before the addition of any other spaces. This is useful for our algorithm to make sure it does not get ahead of itself and respects the breath-first rule.

Then we use a set to keep track of the coordinates that have already been visited - if a set of coordinates has already been visited, we've already looked at their neighbors, there's no need to go back to them! We also use a set because we don't care about the order of the visited coordinates.

## Code in Python

```python
queue = [start]
visited = set()
```

Note that the `queue` is intialized with the starting coordinate and `visited` is empty because no spaces have yet been visited. The algorithm is now ready to be run.
