Now code the `findEnd()` function. This method should accept a predefined maze text file and then return the end coordinates of any maze in tuple form. It should look very similar to `findStart()`.  Remember that we are looking for the letter `e` for the end tuple. The logic for the `findEnd()` function would be exactly the same as `findStart()`.
