In the algorithm, we can use **DFS** to inspect all of the nodes in our graph and assign a color to each node. In order to speed up the process, we can use **Backtracking Search**. Backtracking search will keep track of which colors are valid for a specific vertex. A color is valid if no nodes connected to it already have that same color. If no possible color can be assigned to a vertex (no valid color exists for this node), the program will determine that the graph is not n-colorable.

Let's see this in action with the graph we saw earlier:

In this case, `n` = 2, and we picked red and blue as our colors. Let's walk through step by step to see how this assignment was eventually reached. Assume we used a preorder search pattern. We first assigned a color to `1`. Let's assume that we attempt to assign blue first, red second as colors. Since this was the first node, we had no problem assigning blue to it. We then moved onto `2`. 

Here is where backtracking search came in. We first checked to see if we can assign blue as its color. We cannot! `2` is connected to `1`, which is blue, and thus we have to assign `2` to be red.  We now moved on to `4`.

We attempt to assign blue to `4`. No problem! It is not connected to any blue nodes, and so we can assign its color to be blue. At this point, we have finished traversing `1`'s left tree, so we moved on to its right. We looked at `3` now.

Can we assign blue to `3`? No,  for the same reason as `2`. Since `3` is connected to `1`, which was assigned the color blue, we have to assign to be red. We then move on to `4`, but wait! We already assigned this node its color. At this point, DFS has completed traversing the graph, which means we have solved the problem, and shown that this graph is n-colorable!
