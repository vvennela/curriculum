`initColors()` simply initializes a list colors that holds numVertices 0s and returns the list. Here is the code that allows us to do that:

```Python
def initColors(numVertices):
    colors = [0] * numVertices
    return colors
```

This would create the following list:

We would have received `numVertices` from either the length or width of our `graph` list that we created earlier.
