You must initialize a list for the graph that will become our 2D list adjacency matrix. For now, you can simply put:

```Python
graph = []
```

Then use the content of the CSV file to fill out the 2D list. Append each row into the graph list you just initialized. Remember that the values are separated by commas, and you must read in the values, and not the commas.

**Hint:** You can use Python's `split()` function to remove certain characters from a string.

To illustrate what this means with our previous example, you would need to convert the sample CSV file into the table that we saw. This table will be assigned to `graph`.
