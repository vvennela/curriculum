Since we will have color assignments to all vertices, we must initialize a colors list that is numVertices long. It is okay to initalize the list to all 0s because we will be changing them later on in the program anyway. In other words, using our sample list:

In order to create this list, we first need to determine its length. That's easy, its `4` as that was the number of nodes in our example graph. We would then have needed to initialize all values in the created list to `0` before populating them later with the values you see above.
