Since you are given the Graph `G`, and a map with each node's value, `val_map`, you will need to be using both of these in conjunction with `networkx` functions to visually see your graph. 

First, you need to make sure the graph prints in a "tree" orientation. By default the graph will not be shown as we want it to appear. We would like it to appear as a hierarchal, "tree-like" graph, which is oriented like such:

From the above diagram, one can see that a "tree-like" graph is one in which there are no cycles and there is a parent-child relationship; that is, there is a direct edge between the parent and child. Not every node needs children, but every child node (except the root), will have an associated parent node.

In order to achieve this, you must set the positioning, `pos`,  of the graph's nodes by using the `hierarchy_pos()` function we have provided. Basically, the `hierarchy_pos()` function manually alters the nodes positions, `pos`,  in order to have them oriented in the above manner. This needs to be done manually because `networkx`  currently does not have a predefined layout option to represent a graph in a hierarchal manner. 

Once this is achieved you can will need to use one of the `networkx`  functions that allow you to **draw** the graph, and another to **draw** the graph with **labels** so each node will hold it's filename. Then to actually see the graph, you will need to use the `matplotlib` function to **show** the graph.
