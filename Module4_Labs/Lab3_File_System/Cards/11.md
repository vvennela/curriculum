As per the activity, directed graphs are represented through their node and their edges. So within a file system, each file or folder is a node and each "parent" folder has an edge connecting it to its child folder or file.

The parent/child relationship can be found through reading doing some manipulations on the "structural" number provided. The entire number is mapped to the name of the folder to the right of it, but the first few numbers correlate to the parent folders.

The following are examples of how subfolders are formatted:

* `01` is a subfolder of `0`
* `012` is a subfolder of `01`.
* `0123` is a subfolder of `012`

Quick quiz! What would the subfolder of `0257` be?

It would be a subfolder of `025`! Make sure you understand the subfolder naming scheme as it is key to solving this problem. Making a diagram by hand might help in visualizing the subfolder rules.
