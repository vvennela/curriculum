In this next step, you are going to create a directed graph by writing your own class for it. Your graph object should be able to represent a directed graph so that it can be printed and traversed through.

When representing this graph, think about the **attributes** that a graph has: what are the important aspects of this graph? How are you going to add information that you have parsed from the file to instances of the graph?

You should have parsed the file for the structural numbers and the names of the folders. You should have noticed a pattern in the structural numbers that will give you vital information about the **directionality** of the edges. One thing to consider is how do you traverse folders: do folder have access to the names of the files that are in it, or do the files have access to the names of the folders they are in, or both?

Your graph must have the correct directionality and you have to be able to display the name at it's correct structural location, which can be checked in the following parts.

Friendly reminders:

- graphs can be represented by either its edges, nodes, or both
- the edges in this graph are not weighted, but they are directional
- you will have to print the names of the folders
