We will be representing a simple file structure with a directed graph. You will receive a text file on which to base it off of. The file will contain a bunch of file and folder names written in the format: `###. some words`. The following is an example of a file you could receive.

```
0. Friends
01. Season 1
011. Stranger Things
012. Gotham
013. Prison Break
02. Season 2
021. MADMAX
022. Trick or Treat
...
```

- the numbers representing the "level" of the folder/file. `0` being the root folder and `01` being a subfolder of `0`, so on and so forth. In the example above, `0. Friends` would be the root, while `01. Season 1` would be its subfolder.
  - you can assume that the level or the number of folders/files per level will never surpass `9`
  - you can assume that the root will always be `0`
- `some words` represents the "name" of the folder/file, similar to how you would name your folders

In the first part of the program, you will be required to:

* Parse the file to obtain the structural numbers, *and* the names of the folders/files 
* Find a way to represent these components in a directed graph
* Display the graph using `networkx` and redirect the output to a file
