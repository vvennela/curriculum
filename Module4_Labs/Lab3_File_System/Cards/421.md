In order to visit all of the nodes at least once, we need to keep going until the stack is empty:

```python
        while stack: 
```

Now we need a new `start`, or vertex to visit. In order to do that, we just need to pop the last value off of the `stack`:

```python
start = stack.pop()
```

In order to write all of the information associated with `start`, we need to open a file to write to, and make sure we are appending, `a`, to the file:

```python
f = open("output.txt", "a")
```

We now are writing the correct information to the file here. `start` holds the identifier for a particular node. And we know that we have the "file names" in the `val_map` so we use those as well to replicate the structure of the file you were given:

```python
f.write(start+'. ' + self.val_map[start] + '\n')
```

Even though we are coming back to this file to work on it later, it is good practice to always close the file after opening it:

```python
f.close()
```

Here is the above code fragments shown together:

```python
while stack:
  start = stack.pop()
  f = open("output.txt", "a")
  f.write(start+'. ' +   self.val_map[start] + '\n')
  f.close()
```
