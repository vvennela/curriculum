To add edges to a graph, we first have to initialize a graph. This is done through writing:

```python
G2 = Graph()
```

To be able to create a new Graph object, we have to have a Graph **constructor**, in which we have to initialize any **attributes** it may have. In our case, the edges and the values of the nodes are the most important, so we are going to store them as attributes:

```python
def __init__(self):
	self.edges = defaultdict(list)
	self.val_map = {}
```

To add elements into the edges attribute, we should write a method which adds the edges on by one. Since it is a directed graph, we should accept a `from_node` and a `to_node`:

```python
def add_edge(self, from_node, to_node):
	self.edges[from_node].append(to_node)
```

`from_node` is the node at the "tail" of the edge and `to_node` is the node at the "head" of the edge. Essentially, in `addEdge`, we are forming an edge starting at `from_node` to `to_node` by storing `to_node` in the adjacency list of `from_node`.

It should now make sense *why* properly determining which node is `from_node` and which node is `to_node` affects arrow direction and our algorithm correctness. The arrows of our directed graph start at `from_node` (parent node) and go towards `to_node` (child node). If we flipped this in our code, and had `from_node` point to `to_node`, we would get incorrect results, as we would have our child folder be the parent of our parent folder! 

From the previous code, we should have constructed a list of edges from the file as we were reading it in, storing the parent as the tuple's first element, and it's child as it's second element. But since our function only adds one edge at a time, we have to add the edge as we iterate through the graph:

```python
for edge in edges:
  G2.add_edge(*edge)
```
