We want to finally call `print_ordered_file_structure()` in `main()` in order to write our output to the output file. 

We call it on our `G2` since that is the graph we constructed manually, and we provide the argument `"0"`, since that will signify our *root* of the graph.

```python
 G2.print_ordered_file_structure("0")
```

Here is the function code in its entirety.

```python
visited = defaultdict(bool)
stack = []
stack.append(start)
visited[start] = True
while stack:
  start = stack.pop()
   f = open("output.txt", "a")
   f.write(start+'. ' + 	 self.val_map[start] + '\n')
  f.close()
  lst = self.edges[start]
    		lst.sort()
  lst = lst[::-1]
  for j in lst:
    if visited[j] == False:
      	stack.append(j)
        visited[j] = True
```
