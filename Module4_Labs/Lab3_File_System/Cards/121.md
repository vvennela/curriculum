Recall that we had split each line that we are reading in:

```python
dirAndVal = line.split(". ")
```

that means that `dirAndVal[0]` stores the structral number and `dirAndVal[1]` stores the name. We can simply make a dictionary out of this: 

```python
val_map[dirAndVal[0]] = dirAndVal[1]
```

When you have finished reading the file, you will have made a list of edges and a dictionary of every node and its corresponding name.
