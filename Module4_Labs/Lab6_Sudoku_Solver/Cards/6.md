# complete()

Now that we have all the necessary logic for solving our Sudoku board we will write the functions `hasMoves()` and `complete()`.

![](https://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~sandiway/sudoku/wildcatjan17p.gif)

We will start off with `hasMoves()` first since `complete()` is dependent on it. `hasMoves()` is a very simple function that checks if the `grid` is finished (all empty squares are filled) and thus indicating that the Sudoku board has been solved. `hasMoves()` should retrun a boolean statement to check if all of the squares are filled; is the `grid` is finished, then it should return true, if the `grid` isn't finished, then it should return false and the player has to keep inputting proper numbers to fill in the grid. The function header for `hasMoves()` is defined as such:

```python
def hasMoves(grid):
```

> Hint: `hasMoves()` is a one line function!



Then for our `complete()` function, it will attempt to complete the `grid` by continually calling `nextMove()` until it gets stuck or succeeds. The `complete()` function will continue to iterate throughout the `grid` until it's able to find an empty slot to fill in for solving the `grid` correctly. Our `complete()` function will take in 2 parameters: `grid` for the grid itself and `depth=0` to indicate that the iteration of the grid will start at the 1st index (1st square) of the entire grid. The function header for `complete()` is defined as such:

```python
def complete(grid,depth=0):
```

> Hint: `complete()` uses the functions `hasMoves()` and `nextMove()`
