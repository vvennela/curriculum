# main() Part 2

In the else statement when we've determined that the `grid` is complete, we will need to stop our timer and compute the elapsed time. Also we will print our now complete `grid`:

```python
	else:
		time2 = time.time()
		printGrid(grid)
		if time1 != 0:
			print("Solved in %0.2fs!" % (time2-time1))
		else:
			print("Solved!")
```

We assign `time2` to `time.time()` as this will give us the current time when we have reached inside this else statement. Then once we check that `time1 != 0` to confirm that there was a time recorded for `time1`, we then can compute the time it took to complete the Sudoku board with the computation `time2 - time1` which gives us the total time that it took to complete. We also will call `printGrid(grid)` in order to print our final grid.



Now we have finally finished our Sudoku Solver! This will how our logic will appear for user input options during the process of solving their valid Sudoku board:

```python
time1 = 0

c = input("Controls:\n\t'Enter': Display the next move\n\t'p': Print the current grid (small)\n\t'c': Complete the grid (or attempt to)\n\t'(r,c)': Prints the possible options for that row, column\n")
while hasMoves(grid) and (len(c) == 0 or c == "p" or c == "c" or c[0] == "("):
	if c == "p":
		printGrid(grid)
	elif c == "c":
		time1 = time.time()
		if not complete(grid):
			print("Failed to complete.  Please improve algorithm. :)")
			#break
	elif len(c) > 0 and c[0] == "(":
		print(findPossible(int(c[1])-1,int(c[3])-1,grid))
	else:
		nextMove(grid)

	if hasMoves(grid):
		c = input("Controls:\n\t'Enter': Display the next move\n\t'p': Print the current grid (small)\n\t'c': Complete the grid (or attempt to)\n\t'(r,c)': Prints the possible options for that row, column\n")
	else:
		time2 = time.time()
		printGrid(grid)
		if time1 != 0:
			print("Solved in %0.2fs!" % (time2-time1))
		else:
			print("Solved!")
```

That's it! We are done! Congratulations on completing the Sudoku Solver Lab!
