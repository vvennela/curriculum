# main() Part 2

For the case that the user enters `p` to print the grid, we simply just call the function we have already created to print the grid (`printGrid()`)!

```python
	if c == "p":
		printGrid(grid)
```

For the case that the user enters `c` to complete the grid, we will start the timer on `time1` and call the function we have created to complete the grid (`complete()`). However, the call to complete the grid must be conditioned in the case that the grid cannot be finished. Thus we will prompt the user with this print statement: `"Failed to complete. Please improve algorithm. :)"`

```python
	elif c == "c":
		time1 = time.time()
		if not complete(grid):
			print("Failed to complete.  Please improve algorithm. :)")
			#break
```

For the case that the user enters a row, column pair (`(r, c)`) we need print the possible options for that square. To do this, we will simply print the result from `findPossible()` on the row, column pair the user specified.

```python
	elif len(c) > 0 and c[0] == "(":
		print(findPossible(int(c[1])-1,int(c[3])-1,grid))
```

We do an `int` type cast to ensure that the `findPossible` function can use the actual integer value of the input. We subtract 1 from `int(c[1])` and `int(c[3])` respectively because `findPossible`'s parameters are *indices* (indexing starts at 0!) and the user entered row and column numbers, whose counting starts from 1. 

For the last case where the user enters `enter`, we will just call `nextMove()` to get the next move for the user!

```python
	else:
		nextMove(grid)
```

Now we have implemented the majority of our input handling for procedurally operating through the Sudoku solver. As of now, this is what part 2 of our input handling looks like:

```python
time1 = 0

c = input("Controls:\n\t'Enter': Display the next move\n\t'p': Print the current grid (small)\n\t'c': Complete the grid (or attempt to)\n\t'(r,c)': Prints the possible options for that row, column\n")
while hasMoves(grid) and (len(c) == 0 or c == "p" or c == "c" or c[0] == "("):
	if c == "p":
		printGrid(grid)
	elif c == "c":
		time1 = time.time()
		if not complete(grid):
			print("Failed to complete.  Please improve algorithm. :)")
			#break
	elif len(c) > 0 and c[0] == "(":
		print(findPossible(int(c[1])-1,int(c[3])-1,grid))
	else:
		nextMove(grid)
  if hasMoves(grid):
		c = input("Controls:\n\t'Enter': Display the next move\n\t'p': Print the current grid (small)\n\t'c': Complete the grid (or attempt to)\n\t'(r,c)': Prints the possible options for that row, column\n")
  else:
    # Implement logic for when grid is complete!
```

Now all we have left to implement is the else statement for when the grid is complete (when `hasMoves(grid)` evaluates to false).
