# Introduction

For this lab, we will be building a **Sudoku solver** in python.  For those unfamiliar with the game, there are many resources on the web with information on the rules, and how to play. The basic rules of Sudoku can be expressed as this: Each row, column, and nonet can contain each number (typically 1 to 9) exactly once and the sum of all numbers in any nonet, row, or column must match the small number printed in its corner; for traditional Sudoku puzzles featuring the numbers 1 to 9, this sum is equal to 45.

Your Sudoku Solver should be able to take an unfinished "Sudoku board", represented as a 9x9 2-D list solve the puzzle, and output a finished board in the same format. 

For our program, this is how the initial board should look like:

```python
                            9 4 _ | _ 2 _ | 7 _ _		# the underscores (_) represent
                            _ _ 1 | _ _ 4 | _ _ 9		# blanks/empty on the Sudoku board
                            _ _ 6 | _ _ _ | 1 2 _	
                            ------|-------|-------
                            _ _ _ | _ _ 3 | _ 1 _
                            1 _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ 8
                            _ 7 _ | 5 _ _ | _ _ _
                            ------|-------|-------
                            _ 8 7 | _ _ _ | 2 _ _
                            6 _ _ | 9 _ _ | 3 _ _
                            _ _ 9 | _ 8 _ | _ 5 7
```
This grid above would correspond to a 2-D list that looks like this:

```python
grid = [[9,4,0,0,2,0,7,0,0], [0,0,1,0,0,4,0,0,9], [0,0,6,0,0,0,1,2,0], [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8], [0,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0], [0,8,7,0,0,0,2,0,0], [6,0,0,9,0,0,3,0,0], [0,0,9,0,8,0,0,5,7]]
```

#### Printing the Grid

We will first start off by implementing the `printGrid()` function which will accept a 9x9 2-D list (as seen as `grid` above) and printing it to the screen.  

**Note** that the `grid` contains 0 which doesn't exist in Sudoku, however it represents a blank/empty spot in our Sudoku board. Thus, you will have to handle this case by converting the 0's to an under score (`_`) before printing the board. 

Also notice that the Sudoku board is broken into 9 quadrants where each quadrant is a 3x3 containing 9 numbers. We want to retain this Sudoku board format so you must use pipes (`|`) to separate the column quadrants and dashes (`-`) to separate the row quadrants.

For a starting point, this process will consist of starting at the top of the sudoku board and printing each row as you generate and format the rows moving down the board.

First we will simply start by defining our function which accepts a grid:

```python
def printGrid(grid):
```
