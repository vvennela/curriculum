# findPossible() Function

Now all that's left is to implement the logic needed to traverse through the row, colmn, and box of the square to eliminate values that already exist. 

To check for all the values within the same row of the square, we will define a variable `e` which will be assigned to each of the values in the same row as our square (`r_i`, `c_i`) to be removed from `possible` if `e` is not equal to 0 and exists in `possible`:

```python
	# Row		
  for c in range(0,9):
			e = grid[r_i][c]
			if e != 0 and e in possible:
				possible.remove(e)
```

Notice that `r_i` is fixed while we iterate through `c` from 0 to 8 in order to cover all of the values within the same row (`r_i`) as our square.

Similarly, we will apply the same logic to find all the values that exist (to be removed from `possible`) within the same column as our square:

```python
	# Col
	for r in range(0,9):
		 e = grid[r][c_i]
		 if e != 0 and e in possible:
			 possible.remove(e)
```

The only difference is that we will be iterating from 0 to 8 through `r` to cover all the column values within the same column (`c_i`) as our square.

Last, we will be checking through all the values that exist within the same box as our square. Since we already have the implementation for our nested for-loop, we will simply just iterate through values defined by our range for both `r` and `c` such that `e = grid[r][c]`:

```python
		# Box
		for r in range(0+r_i//3*3,r_i//3*3+3):
			for c in range(0+c_i//3*3,c_i//3*3+3):
				e = grid[r][c]
				if e != 0 and e in possible:
					possible.remove(e)
```

After searching for all possible values by eliminating the existing values within the same row, column and box from `possible`; we will just return `possible` as this list will contain only the values that can be used on our current square (`r_i`, `c_i`). Then our final `findPossible()` function will look like this:

```python
# This finds all possible values for a square by eliminating those in the box that
# it's in, the row, and the column (naive)
def findPossible(r_i, c_i, grid):
	if grid[r_i][c_i] == 0:
		possible = list(range(1,10))
		# Row
		for c in range(0,9):
			e = grid[r_i][c]
			if e != 0 and e in possible:
				possible.remove(e)
		# Col
		for r in range(0,9):
			e = grid[r][c_i]
			if e != 0 and e in possible:
				possible.remove(e)
		# Box
		for r in range(0+r_i//3*3,r_i//3*3+3):
			for c in range(0+c_i//3*3,c_i//3*3+3):
				e = grid[r][c]
				if e != 0 and e in possible:
					possible.remove(e)
		return possible
	else:
		return []
```
