# testPossible()

We first need to duplicate our `grid` to preserve the original `grid` since we are modifying the duplicate by storing the value `n` at the square (`r`,`c`):

```python
def testPossible(grid,r,c,n,depth,finish):
	duplicate = copy.deepcopy(grid)
	duplicate[r][c] = n
```

Once we input the user's guess into `duplicate`, we need to check if `duplicate` will succeed. This is done through our function `complete()`,  which takes as arguments the grid (`duplicate` in this case) and the integer `depth`. We will do this in an if-statement as seen below:

```python
	if complete(duplicate,depth):
```

As of now, our function will look like this altogether:

```python
def testPossible(grid,r,c,n,depth,finish):
	duplicate = copy.deepcopy(grid)
	duplicate[r][c] = n
	if complete(duplicate,depth):
```

If the condition above succeeds, then all we need to do left is check if `finish` is true. If so, then we will copy `duplicate` back to grid since we now have a solution!
