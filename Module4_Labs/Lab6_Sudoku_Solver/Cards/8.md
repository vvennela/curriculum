# main() Part 1

At last, we finally have all of the functions and code necessary to solve any Sudoku puzzle! However, we still need to be able to take the input from the user so we know what puzzle they want to solve and what actions they want to take. 

Before we begin, lets sit down and think of what errors we might possibly want to check for when checking the input from the user? 
Of course, we are asking the user for what board they would like so human error is bound to occur. 

We will first start off by implementing the portion in which we will ask the user what Sudoku puzzle they want to complete. They will be asked to enter in a total of 81 characters, numbers ONLY, for their initial Sudoku board (`grid`). There are two error cases that we need to handle for the Sudoku board that the user specifies:

- If there was not a total of 81 characters, the user will be prompted: 
  - `"Not 81 characters."`
- If the Sudoku board is invalid (What makes a Suduku Board Invalid?), the user will be prompted:
  - `"Invalid grid."`
  > Hint: How do unique values have to correlate with our suduku board?

To provide directions to the user when we are awaiting their input for 81 characters, the prompt will address them to:

- `"Type in the grid, going left to right row by row, 0 = empty: "`



Just for an example of a valid user input for a `grid`, this is what it would appear as:

`940020700001004009006000120000003010100000008070500000087000200600900300009080057`
```
940020700 // First line
001004009 // 2nd Line
006000120 // Third Line
000003010 // Fourth Line
100000008 // Fifth Line
070500000 // Sixth Line
087000200 // Seventh Line
600900300 // Eighth Line 
009080057 // Ninth Line


The input above would correspond to a `grid` that looks like this when printed:

```python
                                  9 4 _ | _ 2 _ | 7 _ _ 
                                  _ _ 1 | _ _ 4 | _ _ 9 
                                  _ _ 6 | _ _ _ | 1 2 _ 
                                  ------|-------|-------
                                  _ _ _ | _ _ 3 | _ 1 _ 
                                  1 _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ 8 
                                  _ 7 _ | 5 _ _ | _ _ _ 
                                  ------|-------|-------
                                  _ 8 7 | _ _ _ | 2 _ _ 
                                  6 _ _ | 9 _ _ | 3 _ _ 
                                  _ _ 9 | _ 8 _ | _ 5 7 
```
