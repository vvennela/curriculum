# main() Part 1

First we will check if the length of `grid` is indeed 0 to confirm that we are ready to await for a user inputted Sudoku board. We will also create a temporary grid `tempGrid` defined as an empty list which we will use to store the user's input. Eventually after we confirm that `tempGrid` is a valid Sudoku board, we will then assign `grid` as `tempGrid`. We will also initialize an empty string `data` which will be the string that holds the 81 characters inputted by the user:

```python
if len(grid) == 0:
	tempGrid = []

	data = ""
```



Since we want to check on whether or not the user inputted 81 characters, that will be the condition we use for our while-loop during the process of accepting the user input:

```python
if len(grid) == 0:
	tempGrid = []

	data = ""
	while len(data) != 81:
```



Then we will output the prompt to the user `"Type in the grid, going left to right row by row, 0 = empty: "` as we request for input:

```python
if len(grid) == 0:
	tempGrid = []

	data = ""
	while len(data) != 81:
		tempGrid = []
		data = input("Type in the grid, going left to right row by row, 0 = empty: ")
```



`data` now contains the string that the user inputted, so we just need to implement the necessary checks to determine for a valid `grid` with a series of if and else statements. We will want to check if the values are unique for each column and row and there is no repeats. We will also want to check if the input size is correct. If the input is correct, we will want to display an error message that tells the user why their input is invalid. 

> Hint: check the size of `data` first and if it is indeed 81 characters then, then store it into `tempGrid` and confirm if `tempGrid` is valid.
