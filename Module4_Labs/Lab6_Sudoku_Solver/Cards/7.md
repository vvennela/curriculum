# testPossible()

Used in conjunction with our guessing clause from the function `nextMove()`, we will now implement the missing piece which is writing the `testPossible()` function. As you have seen previously, this function will:

- Check if it can find a solution given a grid, and then a row-column pair with a value to try.
- If it finds a solution and finish is true, then it sets the grid to the solution so as to speed it up.

For our function, we will be accepting a total of 6 arguments:

- grid: `grid`
- row: `r`
- column: `c`
- current number: `n`
- depth: `depth`
- boolean to indicate if finished: `finish`

The function header for `testPossible()` is defined as such:

```python
def testPossible(grid,r,c,n,depth,finish):
```

Hints:

- You will have to figure out a way to preserve the state of the grid, even when we are storing the value `n` at the row, column pair (`r`, `c`). This is needed to ensure the board maintains itself, even if the user guesses wrong. (Hint: duplication of the board)
- Additionally, you will have to check if the user's guess is correct. You should be using a function you *completed* (big hint) earlier as part of achieving this. Also consider how you will update the grid if a solution has been found.
