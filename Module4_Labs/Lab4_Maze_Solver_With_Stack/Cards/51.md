<!--title={Move Cursor}-->

<!--badges={Python:33}-->

<!--concepts={gotoxy(c,r), Time Module}-->

Write `gotoxy` such as the following to set the cursor at location x and y.

```python
def gotoxy(x, y): #function to show cursor position on screen
    h = windll.kernel32.GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE)
    windll.kernel32.SetConsoleCursorPosition(h, COORD(x, y))
```

`GetStdHandle` gets the output buffer that we want to manipulate. 

`SetConsoleCursorPosition ` sets the cursor of **std_out** to the position of our choice.

Call `gotoxy(x, y)` in solveMaze function, so your cursor can be moving along with you. 

And print out a character, or anything to signifieth the cursor.
