Now we have come to the hardest and most important step of the lab - actually writing the maze solver.

```python
def solveMaze(maze):
```

First of all, construct a while loop, which loops until the exit is found.

Second, check all four directions, see which path is the best for us to step foot on. There's a few things for us to consider, write a corresponding if statement for each of them:

> Is the tile blank?
>
> Is this where we just came from?
>
> Does it lead to a dead end?

Third, what if all the four directions fail the conditions? Then we must be in a dead end! We should mark our current location as dead end, and backtrack our footsteps to go back to where we came from.

Hints:

* Declare  `rowStack` and `columnStack` to keep track of our paths. It should keep track of all the (row, col) locations that we have been.

* Declare two arrays `rowVisited` and `colVisited` to store the paths that lead to dead ends.

* Write a function `inArray(rowVisited, columnVisited, arrSize, r, c)`that check whether a tile is a dead end or not.
* Keep in mind that the maze starts at row: 1, column: 0. So make sure to initialize your location at (1,0) in the map.
