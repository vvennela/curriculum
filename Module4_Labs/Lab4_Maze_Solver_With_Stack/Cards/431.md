<!--title={Four Directions Explained}-->

Using North as an example:

Check if the North tile is blank, so we can evaluate:

```python
maze[curr_row - 1][curr_col] == 32
```

Check if it is the direction where we just came from:

```python
(curr_row - 1) != rowStack.top()
```

Check if it is a dead end, call

```
inArray(rowVisited, colVisited, ROWS*COLUMNS, curr_row - 1, curr_col)
```

Put them together we have:

```python
if ((maze[curr_row - 1][curr_col] == 32) and ((curr_row - 1) != rowStack.top()) and not inArray(rowVisited, colVisited, ROWS*COLUMNS, curr_row - 1, curr_col)):
```

If the tile pass all the if statement then we have to update our location index as well as `rowStack` and `colStack`, which keep track of where we have been.

	rowStack.push(curr_row)
	curr_row = curr_row - 1
	columnStack.push(curr_col)
Do this for all the directions:

```python
if #up
elif #down
elif #left
elif #right
```
