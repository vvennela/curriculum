We can use the index to keep track of the size of the stack. Keep in mind that we defined the first element to be at index 0 before. if there is only one item, the size should be (index+1) which is (0+1). Thus, when we use index to check the size of the stack we always do index + 1 to get the size.

Here, we want to check whether the stack is full, which is the same as checking is the size of the stack equal to row*columns.

Define `isFull` :

```python
return ((self.index + 1) == ROWS*COLUMNS if True else False) #shorthand notation
```

Another way of doing this is:

```python
if ((self.index + 1) == ROWS*COLUMNS): #check whether the number of items is equal to the size of the stack
  return True
else:
  return False
```



We also need a `isEmpty` function to check whether the stack is empty. It's just checking whether the size is equal to 0. As we discussed above the size of the stack is equal to index +1. Here index + 1 should be equal to 0 if it's empty. It's the same as the index is -1 if it's empty.

Another way to define this function is to think about how we defined the `__init__` . We defined it to be at index -1 when it's empty.

Define `isEmpty`  :

```python
return (self.index == -1 if True else False) #shorthand notation
```

It's the same as doing the following

```python
if (self.index == -1): #There is no item in the stack
  return True
else:
  return False
```
