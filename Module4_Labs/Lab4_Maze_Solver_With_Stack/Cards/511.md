Write `gotoxy` such as the following to set the cursor at location x and y.

```python
def gotoxy(x, y): #function to show cursor position on screen
    h = windll.kernel32.GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE) #allows you to write on the console
    windll.kernel32.SetConsoleCursorPosition(h, COORD(x, y)) #determines the position in which to place a cursor on your console. Reference online for documentation on these functions. 
```

`GetStdHandle` gets the output buffer that we wants to manipulate. 

`SetConsoleCursorPosition ` sets the cursor of **std_out** to the position of our choice.

Call `gotoxy(curr_col, curr_row)` in solveMaze function, so your cursor can be moving along with you. 

And print out a character, anything to signifieth the cursor.

Before the while loop for  `mazeSolver`, after we initialize our start, do this:

```python
gotoxy(curr_col, curr_row)
print("X")
```

This will give us an initial position, where we start the game.

In the while loop for `mazeSolver`:

At the beginning of the while loop do:

```python
gotoxy(curr_col, curr_row)
print(" ")
```

This will cause "X" to dissappear when we are about  to move.

Do this again at the end of the while loop, and X will reappear on the map, positioning at the new location.

```python
gotoxy(curr_col, curr_row)
print("X")
```
