Before writing the file to array. Open `fileName`, and read in the data. 

```python
with open(fileName, 'r') as file:
	data = file.readlines()
```

Then, iterate through all the lines in the data and all the words in the line. 

Decipher what each number represent and store them correspondingly to our matrix, representing the map/grid.

```python
    i = 0
    j = 0
    for line in data:    #we iterate line by line
        j = 0
        for word in line:   #we iterate each word in that line
            grid[i][j] = word		
			#blank if '0'
            if grid[i][j] == '0':
                grid[i][j] = 32
			#wall if '1'
            elif (grid[i][j] == '1'):
                grid[i][j] = 9608
			#door (dotted wall) if '3'
            elif (grid[i][j] == '3'):
                grid[i][j] = 9618
            j = j + 1
            if j == COLUMNS:
                break	
        i = i + 1
        if i == ROWS:
            break
```

Here we use a `for loop`  inside another `for loop`  since we want to iterate all the data. We iterate very word in the line than go to the next line iterate all the words in that line. 

Recall that we are storing the Unicode of the blanks, walls, and exit.  Store blanks as 32, walls as 9608, and 9618 as exit, if you want to follow the sample program. But feel free to customize your graphic by your choice of Unicode.

At last, close the file and return the grid.

```python
    file.close()
    return grid
```
