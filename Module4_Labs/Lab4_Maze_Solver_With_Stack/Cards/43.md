Check surrounding tiles to see where could we go next. 

There should be three conditions that we should check for:

1. if the tile is blank
2. if the tile was not most previously visited
3. if the path of the point did not already lead to a dead end.

Only when the tile satisfied these three conditions, should we set foot on it.

Recall that we have two stacks: `rowStack` and `columnStack` to keep track of the paths that we have taken to get to our current location.

Once we decide to set foot into the next tile, we should push our current location to `rowStack` and `columnStack`, and updates our location index, curr_row and curr_col.
