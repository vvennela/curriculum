Declare `curr_row` and `curr_col` to keep track of your current location in the maze.

```python
curr_row = 1
curr_col = 0 
```

Recall that the starting location of the maze is (1,0). So our initialization should reflect that.

Recall that maze array contains the Unicode of our maze, therefore, our while loop should look like: 

```python
while maze[curr_row][curr_col] != # your unicode for exit
```

The Unicode for exit is 9618 in this example, but feel free to customize.
