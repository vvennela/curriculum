In this lab, we will be writing a Maze Solver using Stack as our data structure.

In this Maze Solver, our cursor is represented as X, and it will visit all the branches until it finally finds exit!

When an exit is found, the program will print Done! :)

As a reminder, a stack is an ordered collection of items where addition and removal always takes place at the top of the stack. Think about a stack of plates in a cafÃ©, you always take the top plate which is the last one added to the stack.

Our first task is to write a class `Stack`. 

We will have the following methods in our class:

> `__init__` : initialize two class variables, index and arr. `index` keeps track of the location of the top of the stack, and `arr` is the stack.
>
> `push`: takes in parameter `a` and put it on the top of the stack.
>
> `pop`:  delete the item on top of the stack and return its value.
>
> `top`: return value at the top of stack
>
> `isFull`: check if stack is full
>
> `isEmpty`: check if stack empty
