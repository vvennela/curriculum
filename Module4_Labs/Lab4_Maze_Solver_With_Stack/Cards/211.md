There is an elegant way to initialize a 2D array in one line, and that is:

```python
w, h = COLUMNS, ROWS
grid = [[0 for x in range(w)] for y in range(h)] 
```

`0` is the item `for x in range(w)`.

`[0 for x in range(w)]` is the item `for y in range(h)`.

This is the same as doing the following

```python
w = COLUMNS
h = ROWS
grid = []
for y in range(h):
  row = []
  for x in range(w):
    row.append(0)
  grid.append(row)
```
