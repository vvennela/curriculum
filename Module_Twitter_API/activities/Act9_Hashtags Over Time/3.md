# Make a Time Series of the Tweet Publications

Let's make a **Time series of the tweet publications**, so we can see on which days there were more *tweets* about the chosen topic being produced, and try to find out **which events caused these higher tweet productions**.

We will plot the number of *tweets* being published on each day of a specific month. To show a plot similar to this one, but for a longer period of time, some additional code would have to be added.

First we need to modify the ‘*Timestamp*’ field of our dataframe, to convert it to a **Datetime object**, using Pandas incorporated function *to_datetime*.

```python
tweets['Timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(tweets['Timestamp'], infer_datetime_format = "%d/%m/%Y", utc  = False)
```



Then, we create a function that returns the day of the DateTime object, and apply it to our ‘*Timestamp’* field to create a new column for our dataframe that stores the day when the *tweet* was published. Also, we will group the days together, count the number of *tweets* (using the ‘*text’* field) produced on each day, and create a dictionary **(\*timedict)\*** with the results, where the keys are the number corresponding to the day of the month and the values are the number of *tweets* published on that day.

```python
def giveday(timestamp):
    day_string = timestamp.day
    return day_string
tweets['day'] = tweets['Timestamp'].apply(giveday)
days = tweets.groupby('day')
daycount = days['text'].count()
timedict = daycount.to_dict()
```



After doing this, we are ready to **plot our results!**

```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (15,15))
plt.plot(list(timedict.keys()), list(timedict.values()))
plt.xlabel('Day of the month', fontsize = 12)
plt.ylabel('Nº of Tweets', fontsize=12)
plt.xticks(list(timedict.keys()), fontsize=15, rotation=90)
plt.title('Number of tweets on each day of the month', fontsize = 20)
plt.show()
```

This is what you should get:

If like me, you only collected *tweets* for a couple of days, you will get a very short time series, like the image on the left. The one on the right however, shows a **full month time series** made from a Dataset of *tweets* about the **#Oscars**, which was built by querying the Streaming API for tweets for more than one month. In this second time series, we can see how there are very few *tweets* being produced at the beginning of the month, and as the day of the ceremony comes closer the *tweet* production starts going up, to reach its peak on the night of the event.

Awesome! Now, we will make a plot about the **devices where the tweets are being produced from**.

As the code is pretty much the same code that was used for the previous bar plots, I will just post it here with no further explanation:

```python
#Now lets explore the different devices where the tweets are #produced from and plot these results
devices = tweets.groupby('device')
devicecount = devices['text'].count()
#Same procedure as the for the mentions, hashtags, etc..
device_dict = devicecount.to_dict()
device_ordered_list =sorted(device_dict.items(), key=lambda x:x[1])
device_ordered_list = device_ordered_list[::-1]
device_dict_values = []
device_dict_keys = []
for item in device_ordered_list:
    device_dict_keys.append(item[0])
    device_dict_values.append(item[1])
```



Now we plot and see the results:

```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (12,12))
index = np.arange(len(device_dict_keys))
plt.bar(index, device_dict_values, edgecolor = 'black', linewidth=1)
plt.xlabel('Devices', fontsize = 15)
plt.ylabel('Nº tweets from device', fontsize=15)
plt.xticks(index, list(device_dict_keys), fontsize=12, rotation=90)
plt.title('Number of tweets from different devices', fontsize = 20)

plt.show()
```

By looking at this chart we can see that **most tweets are published from smartphones**, and that inside of this category Android devices beat Iphones by a small margin.

The web produced *tweets* could also be from a mobile device, but are produced from a browser and not from the Twitter app. Aside from this web produced tweets (which we cannot tell if are published from a PC, Mac or mobile web browser), there are very few tweets coming from recognised Macs or Windows devices. These results fit very well with the **relaxed and easy going nature of the Social Network.**

Lastly, let's look at some **additional information** that can be easily obtained from the gathered data

```python
#Lets see other useful information that can be gathered:
#MEAN LENGTH OF THE TWEETS
print("The mean length of the tweets is:", np.mean(tweets['length']))
#TWEETS WITH AN URL
url_tweets = tweets[tweets['text'].str.contains("http")]
print(f"The percentage of tweets with Urls is {round(len(url_tweets)/len(tweets)*100)}% of all the tweets")
#MEAN TWEETS PER USER
print("Number of tweets per user:", len(tweets)/tweets['Username'].nunique())
```

For me this is **145 for the mean length** of the tweets, **23% of the tweets have an URL**, and the **mean tweet production per user is of 2.23 tweets**.

That's it!
