# Check If a User is a Bot or Not

For this we need to download and import the **Botometer** Python library, and get a key to be able to use their API. The information on how do to this can be found on the following link:

[Botometer API Documentation (OSoMe) ](https://rapidapi.com/OSoMe/api/botometer?utm_source=mashape&utm_medium=301)

Also, we will need to retrieve our **Twitter API keys**, as we will need them to allow Botometer to access the information from the accounts whose activity we want to study.

First we will import both libraries. Take into account that Botometer and Tweepy both have to be **previously downloaded** using a package manager of your choice.

```python
#Now we will see the probabilities of each of the users being a bot #using the BOTOMETER API:
import botometer
import tweepy
```

After this, we will **input the API keys** that are needed:

```python
#Key from BOTOMETER API
mashape_key = "ENTER BOTOMETER API KEY"
#Dictionary with the credentials for the Twitter APIs
twitter_app_auth = {
    'access_token' : "ENTER ACCESS TOKEN",
    'access_token_secret' : "ENTER ACCESS TOKEN SECRET",
    'consumer_key' : "ENTER CONSUMER KEY",
    'consumer_secret' : "ENTER CONSUMER SECRET",    
}
```

Like in the last activity, replace the `ENTER...` with the corresponding key and you’re good to go.

Run the following block of code to access the **Botometer API,** and lets see which accounts have the highest chance of being Bots out of the top 25 tweeting users!

```python
#Connecting to the botometer API
bom = botometer.Botometer(wait_on_ratelimit = True, mashape_key = mashape_key, **twitter_app_auth)
#Returns a dictionary with the most active users and the porcentage #of likeliness of them bein a Bot using botometer
bot_dict = {}
top_users_list = dict_keys
for user in top_users_list:
    user = '@'+ user
    try:
        result = bom.check_account(user)
        bot_dict[user] = int((result['scores']['english'])*100)
    except tweepy.TweepError:
        bot_dict[user] = 'None'
        continue
```

The output of this block is a **dictionary (bot_dict)** where the keys are the names of the accounts we are checking, and the value is a numerical **score between 0 and 1** that depicts the probability of each user being a bot by taking into account certain factors like the ration of followers/followees, the description of the account, frequency of publications, type of publications, and more parameters.

For some users, the Botometer API gets a **rejected request error**, so these will have a ‘*None*’ as their value.

For me, I get the following results when checking **bot_dict**:

```python
{'@CryptoKaku': 25,
 '@ChrisWill1337': 'None',
 '@Doozy_45': 44,
 '@TornadoNewsLink': 59,
 '@johnnystarling': 15,
 '@brexit_politics': 42,
 '@lauramarsh70': 32,
 '@MikeMol1982': 22,
 '@EUVoteLeave23rd': 66,
 '@TheStephenRalph': 11,
 '@DavidLance3': 40,
 '@curiocat13': 6,
 '@IsThisAB0t': 68,
 '@Whocare31045220': 'None',
 '@EUwatchers': 34,
 '@c_plumpton': 15,
 '@DuPouvoirDachat': 40,
 '@botcotu': 5,
 '@Simon_FBFE': 42,
 '@CAGeurope': 82,
 '@botanic_my': 50,
 '@SandraDunn1955': 36,
 '@HackettTom': 44,
 '@shirleymcbrinn': 13,
 '@JKLDNMAD': 20}
```

Out of these, the account with the highest chance of being a Bot is **@CAGeurope, with a probability of 82%.** Lets check out this account to see why Botometer assigns it such a high probability of being a Bot.

It looks like a legit account, however, there are various reasons that explain why Botometer gave it such a high probability of being a Bot. First, the account follows almost **3 times as many accounts** as the number of accounts that follow it. Secondly, if we look at the **periodicity of their tweet publications**, we can see that they consistently produce various tweets every hour, sometimes in 5 minute intervals, which is a LOT of *tweets*. Lastly, the **content** of their *tweets* is always very similar, with a short text, an URL and some hashtags.

In case you don’t want to code anything or get an API key, Botometer also provides a **web based solution**, where you can also check the probability of an account being a Bot:
