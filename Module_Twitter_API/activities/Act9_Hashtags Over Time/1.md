# Twitter Visualisation

In this activity, we will describe other awesome visualisations, while also exploring some more information that can be obtained from the downloaded *tweets*.

We will start by discovering **information about the users** who are posting the *tweets*:

```python
#Lets take a look at the users who are posting these tweets:
print("There are {} different users".format(tweets['Username'].nunique()))
```

In my case, the *tweets* were posted by **59508 different users**.

Using our neatly prepared **dataframe** we can see who are the users that posted the most *tweets*, and something even cooler: see the chance of the highly active users being **Bots**!

```python
#Going to see who are the users who have tweeted or retweeted the #most and see how
#Likely it is that they are bots
usertweets = tweets.groupby('Username')
#Taking the top 25 tweeting users
top_users = usertweets.count()['text'].sort_values(ascending = False)[:25]
top_users_dict = top_users.to_dict()
user_ordered_dict =sorted(top_users_dict.items(), key=lambda x:x[1])
user_ordered_dict = user_ordered_dict[::-1]
#Now, like in the previous hashtags and mention cases, going to make #two lists, one with the username and one with the value
dict_values = []
dict_keys = []
for item in user_ordered_dict[0:25]:
    dict_keys.append(item[0])
    dict_values.append(item[1])
```

This block of code is very similar to the ones we used in the last activity to see the most used *hashtags* or mentioned users. Now, we will plot the results.

```python
#Plot these results
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (15,15))
index = np.arange(25)
plt.bar(index, dict_values, edgecolor = 'black', linewidth=1)
plt.xlabel('Most active Users', fontsize = 18)
plt.ylabel('NÂº of Tweets', fontsize=20)
plt.xticks(index,dict_keys, fontsize=15, rotation=90)
plt.title('Number of tweets for the most active users', fontsize = 20)
plt.savefig('Tweets_of_active_users.jpg')
plt.show()
```

This is what you should get:

As we can see, the **most active user** is *@CrytoKaku*, with more than 400 posted tweets. That is a lot! Is he/she a Bot? Lets check it out!
