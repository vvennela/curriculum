# Cursor class

Now, we are going to make use of the cursor module that we imported as well as extract timeline tweets from your own timeline.

Let's start by declaring a new class and constructor method:

```python
class TwitterClient():
  def __init__(self, twitter_user=None):
        self.auth = TwitterAuthenticator().authenticate_twitter_app()
        self.twitter_client = API(self.auth)
        self.twitter_user = twitter_user
```

>self.auth is the authenticator object (We use this to properly authenticate to communicate with the Twitter API)



 Now, let's make a function that allows a user to get tweets:

```python
def get_user_timeline_tweets(self, num_tweets):
  tweets = [] //Empty list
	for tweet in Cursor(self.twitter_client.user_timeline).items(num_tweets):
  		tweets.append(tweet)
  return tweets
```

> num_tweets allows us to know how many tweets we actually want to show or extract 

> The client object that we created here in the in the constructor. There's a method for every object derived from this API class that has this user timeline functionality and that allows you to specify a user to get the tweets off that user's timeline. We have not specified a user; therefore, it defaults to you and will get tweets from your own timeline. There's a parameter for the cursor object called `.items` that allows you to specify the amount of tweets to receive from the timeline.



Now let's test what we have works so far:

Under `if_name _ == '_ main_ '` insert:

```python
	twitter_client = TwitterClient()
    print(twitter_client.get_user_timeline_tweets(1))
```

Comment out some of the lines, as they are not necessary for this test:

```python
#   twitter_streamer = TwitterStreamer()
#   twitter_streamer.stream_tweets(fetched_tweets_filename, hash_tag_list)
```

If it works properly, you should get the most recent tweet from your twitter timeline.
