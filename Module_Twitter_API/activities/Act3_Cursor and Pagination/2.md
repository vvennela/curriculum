# Making Authentication into Its Own Class

Now let's abstract the Authentication into its own class so that we can use it to authenticate for other purposes in this activity.

First, we are going to do some changes to the code we wrote in **tweepy_streamer.py**:

- Change ```class StdOutListener(StreamListener)``` to ```class TwitterListener(StreamListener)```

- Remember to also change the function call also (Ex: ``` listener = StdOutListener(fetched_tweets_filename)``` to ``` listener = TwitterListener(fetched_tweets_filename)```)

- We are also going to abstract the authentication into its own class:

  ```python
  # # # # TWITTER AUTHENTICATER # # # #
  class TwitterAuthenticator():
  
      def authenticate_twitter_app(self):
          auth = OAuthHandler(twitter_credentials.CONSUMER_KEY, twitter_credentials.CONSUMER_SECRET)
          auth.set_access_token(twitter_credentials.ACCESS_TOKEN, twitter_credentials.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
          return auth
  ```

- We are also going to change some of the things in the  ```TwitterStreamer()``` class since we moved the authentication into its own class:

  ```python
  def __init__(self):
          self.twitter_autenticator = TwitterAuthenticator()    
  
      def stream_tweets(self, fetched_tweets_filename, hash_tag_list):
          # This handles Twitter authetification and the connection to Twitter Streaming API
          listener = TwitterListener(fetched_tweets_filename)
          auth = self.twitter_autenticator.authenticate_twitter_app() 
          stream = Stream(auth, listener)
  
          # This line filter Twitter Streams to capture data by the keywords: 
          stream.filter(track=hash_tag_list)
  ```

  > Here, we changed the init fucntions to the class. We also changed auth = self.twitter_autenticator.authenticate_twitter_app()  within the stream_tweets class method
