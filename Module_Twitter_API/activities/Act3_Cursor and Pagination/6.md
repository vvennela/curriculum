# Some other Class Methods for the Cursor class

```python
 def get_friend_list(self, num_friends):
        friend_list = []
        for friend in Cursor(self.twitter_client.friends, id=self.twitter_user).items(num_friends):
            friend_list.append(friend)
        return friend_list
```

```python
def get_home_timeline_tweets(self, num_tweets):
        home_timeline_tweets = []
        for tweet in Cursor(self.twitter_client.home_timeline, 			   id=self.twitter_user).items(num_tweets):
            home_timeline_tweets.append(tweet)
        return home_timeline_tweets
```

> These two are also some of the class methods we can use for the Cursor class. They are pretty similar to the one we wrote before. We're looping over `twitter_client.friends` in this case instead of the user timeline. Then, we're getting a certain number of friends of that user based on the argument that we passed into the function. The patterns are very similar!
