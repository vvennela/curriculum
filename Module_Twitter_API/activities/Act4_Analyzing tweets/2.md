<h1>Getting the Twitter Client API</h1>
Let's start by getting the twitter api. Firstly, let's setup a function inside our `TwitterClient` class that will return the api. We do so as follows:

```python
def get_twitter_client_api(self):
        return self.twitter_client
```

Next, let's create a twitter client which we'll use to analyze the tweet data of the user we'll be specifying that we'll be receiving in JSON format. We'll start by removing the existing code inside the main portion of our file and create an object of the `TwitterClient()` class called `twitter_client`. 

```python
twitter_client = TwitterClient()
```

Now let's get the api through the function we just created and store it inside a variable for analyzing in the future.

```python
api = twitter_client.get_twitter_client_api()
```
