<h1>Analyzing the tweets</h1>
Finally the most exciting part...Analyzing the tweets! We already have the text field set up so now let's add columns for other fields such as the id, likes, retweets, etc. We do so by using the numpy arrays and adding one column at a time. The data fed into this is similar to what we did before.

```python
df['id'] = np.array([tweet.id for tweet in tweets]) #Gets the tweet id
df['len'] = np.array([len(tweet.text) for tweet in tweets]) #Gets the length of the text
df['date'] = np.array([tweet.created_at for tweet in tweets]) #Gets the tweet date
df['source'] = np.array([tweet.source for tweet in tweets]) #Gets the device on which the tweet was uploaded
df['likes'] = np.array([tweet.favorite_count for tweet in tweets]) #Gets the amount of likes
df['retweets'] = np.array([tweet.retweet_count for tweet in tweets]) #Gets the amount of retweets
```

So what we have now is,
