By the end of this activity, we'll be able to stream and analyze tweets from a specific user. We'll be using the tweepy library along with Pandas and Numpy to format our tweet data that we'll be analyzing later. So let's start by setting up Pandas and Numpy.

<h1>Setting up Pandas and Numpy</h1>
Let's start by setting up Pandas and Numpy. If you don't have these installed, you'll have to run the following commands.

```bash
pip install Pandas
pip install Numpy
```

And then, In order to use Pandas and Numpy in your Python IDE ([Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)), you need to *import* them first as `import pandas as pd ` and `import numpy as np `.
