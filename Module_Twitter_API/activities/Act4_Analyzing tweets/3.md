<h1>Streaming our first tweets</h1>
So now that we have an api set up, we can start by streaming some tweets. So let's go ahead and create a variable called `tweets` that will store the data we'll be obtaining from the client that we just created. We'll use a inbuilt function, `user_timeline` to stream the tweets. So let's go ahead and specify someone well known as the twitter handle and specify the number of tweets we need.

```python
tweets = api.user_timeline(screen_name="realDonaldTrump", count=20)
```

Now on printing `tweets`, we should get the most recent 20 tweets in JSON format.
