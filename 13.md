## Objects Basics

Almost all objects in JavaScript are parts of the keyword `Object`. Objects are usually initialized with the `Object()` method. 

 Objects "inherit" their properties from other objects, often called "object prototypes." This inheritance based on linking prototypes together is known as the "prototype chain." Prototypes are defined by `Object.prototype`

Objects can be thought of as a variable that holds many data types in **name:value** pairs. We can access the data stored in objects by calling the name. 

```JavaScript
let button = {
 	name: "color changer",
  text: "this changes colors",
  buttonwords: () => this.name + " " + this.text
  }
};
```

We can call the properties in this object in two ways: 

```JavaScript
object.name
// or 
object['name']
```

We could call the first name of the `person` variable like this:

```JavaScript
let call = button.name;
// or
let call = button['name'];
```

We've been using objects and their methods this whole time! 

```JavaScript
document.write("Hello World!")
```

The `write()` method is modifying the `document` object.
