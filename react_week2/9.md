# Arrow Functions

ES6 introduced "Arrow Functions", which make using functions easier. 

Here's the "Hello World!" as how we did it earlier

<script> 
 document.write("Hello World!");
</script>

And here's "Hello World!" using a function

<script>
  hello = function(){
    return "Hello World!"
  }
</script>

And here's "Hello World" using an Arrow Function

<script>
  hello = () => "Hello World!"
</script>

Notice that the function got shorter! If the function has one value and has a return function, we can omit the `function` and `return` statement all together. 

This provides compactness and clarity to the code.
