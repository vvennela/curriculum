# How is JavaScript written? 

## Introduction to the Basics

JS is written by inserting a "script" tag into the HTML webpage as shown here:

<head>
  <body>
    <script>
    </script>
  </body>
</head>

The script tag can be placed in either the header tag or the body tag. 

Now that you know how JavaScript looks like internally on the webpage, let's create the classic Hello World function in Java Script using the document.write() function. 

**Always** remember to add semicolons at the end of each line because that's how the script knows to end reading the line. 

<head>
  <body>
    <script>
      document.write("Hello World!");
    </script>
  </body>
</head>


We can also internally format the document.write() using headers. It would look like this: 

  <head>
    <body>
      <script>
        document.write("<h1>Hello World!</h1>");
      </script>
    </body>
  </head>

JavaScript takes two attributes, language and type, both of which are placed inside the starting script tag.

<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"> 
 document.write("Hello World!");
</script>

You no longer need the type attribute because JS is the default scripting language for HTML. 

The unique part about JavaScript is that you can generate a webpage using only JavaScript.

## External JS

Scripts can be accessed through external files. JS files have the extensions .js. 

Let's access an external file.

- First, open a text file and name it "test.js"

- In the text file, write down alert("You did it!");

Then, run this:

   <head>
     <script **src="test.js"**></script>
   </head>

External scripts should not contain the script tag.
