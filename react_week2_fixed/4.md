## The If/Else Statements

Let's examine the first one, the `if` and `else` conditional. 

```javascript

 	let buttonsize = 4;
  if (buttonsize < 5)
  {
    document.write("Button is too small!");
  } 
  else
  {
    document.write("Button is too big!");
  }
```

The if/else statemenent checks the condition and then does whatever the specific condition we make it do. 

What does the above code block do?

What happens if we have more than one condition? 

Enter the "else if" condition
