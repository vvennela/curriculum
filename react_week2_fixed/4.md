## The If/Else Statements

Let's examine the first one, the `if` and `else` conditional. 

```javascript

 	let buttonsize = 4;
  if (buttonsize < 5)
  {
    document.write("Button is too small!");
  } 
  else
  {
    document.write("Button is too big!");
  }
```

The above block of code will print `Button is too small!` because the condition that button size<5 is fulfilled. 

If buttonsize was equal to or greater than 5 (buttonsize>=5), the `else` statement would have been printed.

What happens if we have more than one condition? 

Enter the "else if" condition
