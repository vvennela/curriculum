## The If/Else Statements

Let's examine the first one, the `if` and `else` conditional. 

```javascript

 	let carage = 4;
  if (carage < 5)
  {
    document.write("I love cars!");
  } 
  else
  {
    document.write("I don't like this car");
  }
```

The above block of code will print `I love cars!` because the condition that carage<5 is fulfilled. 

If carage was equal to or greater than 5 (carage>=5), the `else` statement would have been printed.

What happens if we have more than one condition? 

Enter the "else if" condition
