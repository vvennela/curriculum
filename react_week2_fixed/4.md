## Switch

The switch statements evaluates the variable and looks for `cases` which would match the initial condition. 

``` javascript
  const fruit = 'Papayas';
switch (fruit) {
  case 'Oranges':
    comsole.log('Oranges are $0.59 a pound.');
    break;
  case 'Papayas':
    console.log('Papayas are $2.79 a pound.');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('Sorry, we are out of ' + fruit + '.');
}
```

We set "fruit" to Papayas, which means that the script will evaluate each case until it finds the appropriate case, and then it will execute that case. 

Note that switch statements have a `default`, which is what the script will default to if the condition doesn't have an associated case.

When writing a switch statement, don't forget to include a `break` which would "break" out of the conditional once if has executed the condition. A more-indepth look will be provided when we go over loops.
