## Loops

For loops iterate a certain amount of times, often dictated by the amount of items in an array. Let's look at an example and dissect it from there: 

JavaScript writes a for loop like this: 

You've probably seen for loops written similarly from other language:

``` javascript
  let buttoncolor = ["Red", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow", "Maroon", "Black"];
	let i;
	for (i = 0; i < buttonColor.length; i++) {
  	console.log(buttonColor[i] + ", ")
  }
	while (i < buttonColor.length) { 
    
  }

```

This script will iterate 5 times and will print this: `Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Maroon, Black`

where x is executed once before the code block, y defines the condition to the execution of the code block, and z executes after the code block has been executed. 

To exit out of a loop, use the `break` keyword and to skip to the next iteration, use the `continue` keyword.  

Instead of using the traditional for loop, JavaScript provides an easier-to-read loop: 



## For Each Loop

The For Each loop is a way to iterate through an object's properties. 

```javascript
let sum = 0;
let obj = {prop1: 5, prop2: 13, prop3: 8};

for each (let item in obj) {
  sum += item;
}

console.log(sum); // logs "26", which is 5+13+8
```
