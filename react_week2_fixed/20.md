## Button

With our new knowldge of JavaScript and HTML, let's make a button which on click, which would change colors!

This is one way we can do it:

```html
<button id = "colorbutton" onClick = "changeButtonColor()">click to change color</button>

<script>

function changeButtonColor() {

document.getElementById("myButton").style.backgroundColor = "yellow";

}

</script>
```

This is how the button would look like before clicking it:

And this is the button after it is clicked:
