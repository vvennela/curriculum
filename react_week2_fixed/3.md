## The If/Else Statements

Let's examine the first one, the `if` and `else` conditional. 

```javascript

 	let buttonsize = 4;
  if (buttonsize < 5)
  {
    console.log("Button is too small!");
  } 
  else
  {
    console.log("Button is too big!");
  }
```

The if/else statemenent checks the condition and then does whatever the specific condition we make it do. 

What does the above code block do?

What happens if we have more than one condition? 

Enter the "else if" condition

## Else if 

The `else if` condition is used if the first condition is false. Let's modify our code so that we can use an `else if` function. 

``` javascript
 	let buttonsize = 4;
  if (buttonsize < 5)
  {
    document.write("Button is too small!");
  } 
  else if (buttonsize===5)
    {
      alert("Perfect size!");
    }
  else
  {
    document.write("Button is too big!");
  }
```

Recall that `===` is what we use to equate. What does this code block do? 

Write an if/else statement which checks to see if button font is bigger than 32 pp, and if it is, it will print("this is large"). However, otherwise, the code will print("this is small!")
