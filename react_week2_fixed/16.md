## Arrays

JavaScript allows arrays, a special type of object.

This is an example of an array:

`let fruit = ["Mango", "Apple", "Banana"]`

It functions as a list. The easiest way to create an array is

`let array_name = [item1, item2, item3...]`

JS has a keyword named `new` which creates and assigns values to it: 

`let fruit = new Array ("Mango", "Apple", Banana)`

To access an item of an array, we reference the **index number**

`let name = fruit[0]` will return the first item in the array, which is "Mango". In JS, indexing starts at "0", meaning that the first item is referenced as 0.

What happens if we want to change an item in an array? We do this: 

`fruit[0]=Watermelon` This assigns the first item to the value "Watermelon" 

We can use different methods to perform a variety of functions. For instance, the following block will give us the length of the fruit array. 

`let  x = fruit.length();`

There are several other methods:
