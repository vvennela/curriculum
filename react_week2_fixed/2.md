## Introduction to JavaScript

JS is written by inserting a "script" tag into the HTML webpage as shown here:

<head></head>
 <body>
   <script></script>
 </body>

## External JS

Although the <script> tag is used on HTML, we often use external JavaScripts. As such, make sure to make scripts in external files. Scripts can be accessed through external files. JS files have the extensions .js. 

Let's access an external file.

- First, open a text file and name it "test.js"

- In the text file, write down `alert("You clicked the button");`

Then, run this:

   <head>
     <script src="test.js"></script>
   </head> 

External JavaScripts can either be put into the head or body part of the DOM. For the rest of the course, we'll be making new files and using external JavaScript in order to initialize the code.

External scripts should not contain the script tag.
