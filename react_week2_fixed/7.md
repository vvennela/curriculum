## For Loops

For loops iterate a certain amount of times, often dictated by the amount of items in an array. Let's look at an example and dissect it from there: 

``` javascript
  let buttoncolor = ["Red", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow", "Maroon", "Black"];
	let i;
	for (i = 0; i < buttoncolor.length; i++) {
  	document.write(buttoncolor[i] + ", ")
  }
```

This script will iterate 5 times and will print this: `Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Maroon, Black`

Recall that arrays start indexing their first item as buttoncolor[0]. This means that buttoncolor[5] becomes `Black`. Hence, we can print all of the array. 

The general format of the for loop is as follows: 

`for (x,y,z){`

`code to be executed`

`}`

where x is executed once before the code block, y defines the condition to the execution of the code block, and z executes after the code block has been executed. 

What will this print? 

```javascript
let buttonsizes=["10","20","30","40"];
let x;
for (x=2; x<3; x++){
  document.write(buttonsizes[i]+",")
}
```

Remember that the first value in JavaScript is actually 0!
