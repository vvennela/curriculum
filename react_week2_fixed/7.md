## For Loops

For loops iterate a certain amount of times, often dictated by the amount of items in an array. Let's look at an example and dissect it from there: 

``` javascript
  let fruit = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Melon", "Peach", "Plum"];
	let i;
	for (i = 0; i < fruit.length; i++) {
  	document.write(fruit[i] + ", ")
  }
```

This script will iterate 5 times and will print this: `Apple, Banana, Orange, Melon, Peach, Plum`

Recall that arrays start indexing their first item as fruit[0]. This means that fruit[5] becomes Plum. Hence, we can print all of the array. 

The general format of the for loop is as follows: 

`for (x,y,z){`

`code to be executed`

`}`

where x is executed once before the code block, y defines the condition to the execution of the code block, and z executes after the code block has been executed.
