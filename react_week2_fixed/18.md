## .reduce()

Just like `.map()`, `.reduce()` looks through all the elements in an array but only returns one value that you want. Let's look at an example: 

```javascript
let people = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Mike",
    years: 64,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Joe",
    years: 79,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "Richard",
    years: 58,
  }
];
// we want the oldest person in this array
```

Using `.reduce()`, we'll be able to find the oldest person in the array: 

```javascript
let oldestperson = people.reduce(function (old, people) {
  return (old.years || 0) > people.years ? old : people;
}, {});
```

Naming the accumulator `old` is a way to check each element in an array. If one person is older than the other, then that person becomes the new `old`.
