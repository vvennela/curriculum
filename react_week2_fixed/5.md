## Else if 

The `else if` condition is used if the first condition is false. Let's modify our code so that we can use an `else if` function. 

``` javascript
  let carage = 5;
  if (carage < 5)
  {
    document.write("I love cars!");
  } 
  else if (carage===5)
    {
      alert("This one's alright");
    }
  else
  {
    document.write("I don't like this car");
  }
```


Recall that `===` is what we use to equate. In this certain block of code, the script would print out `This one's alright` because it is the only condition which is true.
