## Else if 

The `else if` condition is used if the first condition is false. Let's modify our code so that we can use an `else if` function. 

``` javascript

 	let buttonsize = 4;
  if (buttonsize < 5)
  {
    document.write("Button is too small!");
  } 
  else if (buttonsize===5)
    {
      alert("Perfect size!");
    }
  else
  {
    document.write("Button is too big!");
  }
```


Recall that `===` is what we use to equate. In this certain block of code, the script would print out `This one's alright` because it is the only condition which is true.
