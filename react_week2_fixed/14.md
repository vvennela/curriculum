## Objects Advanced

Now that we know how Objects look like in JavaScript, let's constuct our own objects. 

``` JavaScript
let person = {
  name: "John", 
  age: 10, 
  hometown: "davis"
}
```

This method only allows you to create one object. If we want to create several objects, we will want to create an object type. 

```javascript
function person(name, age, hometown){
  this.name=name;
  this.age=age;
  this.hometown=hometown;;
}
// the keyword "this" is a reserved keyword which refers to the current object
// "this" is not a variable and cannot be changed
```

This is an "object constructor", which takes parameters and allows the assignment to object properties. Now, if we want to create new object, we can use the `new` keyword

```javascript
function person(name, age, hometown){
  this.name=name;
  this.age=age;
  this.hometown=hometown;
}
let John= new person("John",10,"davis")
```
