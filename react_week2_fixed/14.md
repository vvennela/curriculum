## Events

Events allow the user to interact with the webpage and is what sets JavaScript apart from other languages.

``` JavaScript
  document.querySelector('html').onclick = function() {
    alert('Now, this is interactive!');
```


The `querySelector` selects the `<html>` element, setting onclick to a nameless function, which are also called anonymous functions, and generating the alert. 

Let's generate another event, one that tells us the date and time: 

``` javascript
function displayDate() {
  document.getElementById("time").innerHTML = Date();
}
```

When run, this little bit of code will allow us to generate the time that it currently is using JavaScript. Of course, we're going to need someway to generate the date and time, and for that we would use the button function in HTML. That's going to be your challenge activity. 

Here's a common list of events:

Construct an event which, on mouseover, will perform an `alert()`
