## Objects Advanced

Now that we know how Objects look like in JavaScript, let's constuct our own objects. 

``` JavaScript
let button = {
  color: "blue", 
  size: 50, 
  content: "click me!"
}
```

This method only allows you to create one object. If we want to create several objects, we will want to create an object type. 

```javascript
function button(color, size, content){
  this.color=color;
  this.size=size;
  this.content=content;;
}
// the keyword "this" is a reserved keyword which refers to the current object
// "this" is not a variable and cannot be changed
```

This is an "object constructor", which takes parameters and allows the assignment to object properties. Now, if we want to create new object, we can use the `new` keyword

```javascript
function button(color, size, content){
  this.color=color;
  this.size=size;
  this.content=content;;
}
let orderbutton= new button("blue",50,"clickme!")
```

Let's make an object `button` which has three elements: font size, font, and color.
