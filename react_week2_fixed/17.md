## .map()

Using the `map()` keyword simplifies the indexing of arrays and returns the value you want. 
Let's assume that you recieve an array with the name and age of several people. However, you only want the ages of the people. 

```javascript
let button = [
  { color: "blue", text: 'click me!' },
  { color: "red", text: 'test button' },
  { color: "black", text: 'generate!' },
  { color: "green", text: 'see results!' }
];
// we want the color of the button
```

You can use `.map()` to return the age of this object.

```javascript
const buttoncolor = button.map(button => button.color);
```

`.map` looks through each individual element of an array and returns only what we are looking for.
