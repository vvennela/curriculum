## .filter()

`.filter()`, like both `.map()` and `.reduce()` is a way to generate values that you'd want. 

```javascript
let student = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "amy",
    hometown: "stockton",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "bree",
    hometwon: "sacramento",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "cierra",
    hometown: "sacramento",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    name: "diana",
    hometown: "stockton",
  }
];
// we want two arrays, one for the students from stockton, and the other for the students from sacramento
```

We'd create the two arrays like this:

```javascript
const stockton  = student.filter(student => student.hometown === "stockton");
const sacramento = student.filter(student => student.homewtown === "sacramento");
```

This checks if the value in hometown returns true for each function, which would place that value in the array.
