## Continue

Continue values are like the "opposite" of breaks. Instead of breaking out of the loop, they reiterate the function:

``` javascript
  let text = "";
	let i;
	for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  	if (i === 3) { continue; }
  	text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
document.write(text)
```


The result will skip over 3 until it reaches the end of the loop and then it will contunue to the next code block.
