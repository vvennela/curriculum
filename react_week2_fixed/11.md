## Arrow Functions

ES6 introduced "Arrow Functions", which make using functions easier. 

Here's the "Hello World!" as how we did it earlier

``` JavaScript
document.write("Hello World!");
```

And here's "Hello World" using an Arrow Function

``` JavaScript
const hello = () => "Hello World!"
```


Notice that the function got shorter. If the function has one value and has a return function, we can omit the `function` and `return` statement all together. 

This provides compactness and clarity to the code. 

Let's write this function as an arrow function:

```javascript
let addition = function (x,y){
  return x+y
}
```

This is how they were traditionally written: 

## Functions

A function in JavaScript is a block of code which is designed to do something. When the function is invoked, the code performs a certain task. In the example below, we want to multiply two numbers. 

``` javascript
  let x = buttonFunction(4, 3);   
function buttonFunction = (a, b) => {
  return a * b;            
}
```


The result will be 12. 

When the code hits the `return`, the code will stop executing. 

The general format for a function is as follows:

`function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3...){`

`code to be executed`

}

Functions are usefull because they can be defined according to our needs and can be used however we see fit. 

Make your own function which adds two numbers!

Answer:

```javascript
let x = buttonAdd(30,50)
function buttonAdd(a,b){
  return a+b;
}
```
