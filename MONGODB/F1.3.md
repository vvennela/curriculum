# F1.2: Introduction to Stitch + Using Stitch

Another component of MongoDB is using Stich, which allows you to configure rules, authentication and other services for your services. To fully understand Stitch, let's build a blog which allows you to post and edit comments. 

Make sure you've created your cluster and your account to access and finish this tutorial. 

## Step 1: Creating a Stitch Application

1. On the left, click Stitch and create a new application and give it a name(ie StichEx)

2. After waiting a few minutes to initalize, you should reach the starting screen(again):

## Step 2: Authentication

On the starting page, scroll down and turn on "Anonymous Authentication." There are other ways to configure authentication, such as through Google or through username and password authentication.

## Step 3: Setting Rules for the Application

1. On the Stich Homepage, click "Rules"
2. Add a collection and set the database name to "Comment Ex"
3. Set the collection name to comments
4. Select "No Template" and add collection
5. Under the "default" column, tick both "read" and "write" so the database can store comments 
6. Click "save"
