<!--title={JSON ME}-->

RESTful API servers are built with JSON (**J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation) and uses key-value pairs. JSON is a very common way of transferring information on the web. 



In this activity you'll create a server that uses a GET request with express, and reads a profile of a superhero that's in JSON format. You'll then output to the user a regular string version of the JSON sentence. 

The actual JSON will look something like this: 

```json
{
      "name": "Madame Uppercut",
      "age": 39,
      "secretIdentity": "Jane Wilson",
      "powers": [
        "Million tonne punch",
        "Damage resistance",
        "Superhuman reflexes"
      ]
}
```



Great! Now that we know what the file looks like, let's start with defining our app:

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
```

Next, we'll define the GET structure of our function. To explain, the following code is executed if the user accesses the `/json` route. 

```js
app.get('/json', function(req, res) { 
	// we'll fill in the code here!
})
```

We're going to assume the user puts a JSON object into the request body, accessed by `req.body`. In our code, let's try to access the `req.body`, but we should check if it's there using an `if` statement:  The code is saying if there is something in the body called sentence, we should do something with it. 

```js
app.get('/json', function(req, res) { 
	if (req.body.sentence) { 
  	// If there are items in the req.body
  }
})
```

Now, we'll use the `JSON.parse()` function to actually parse the JSON. JSON.parse() returns an object we can access, so we'll store it in an object. 

```js
var object = JSON.parse(req.body.sentence)
```

Finally, we'll return the name of the user: 

```js
res.send(object.name)
```

Your final code should look like: 

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.get('/json', function(req, res) { 
	if (req.body.sentence) { 
  	var object = JSON.parse(req.body.sentence)
    res.send(object.name)
  }
})
```
