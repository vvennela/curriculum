<!--title={Query Strings}-->

Another way to pass items into the URL is in a **key** and **value** pair. Keys and values are placed after a `?` and associated by the `=`. The format to use a quer string is:  

```
/route?key1=value1
```

If we wanted to get multiple keys and pairs, you could add an `&`in the URL. Here's an example format: 

```
/route?key1=value1&key2=value2
```



In this exercise, we'll use a query string! Let's create a application that listens to the `/search` route and extracts the first name and age of a person whose information will be passed into the URL. Name your file `query.js`.



Let's get started! First, let's create our app:

``````javascript
const express = require('express') 
const app = express()
``````

Once we have created the app, we will then define our get/seach functions with a request handler:

```javascript
app.get('/search', function(req, res){
  // we'll fill in the code here!
}
```

Next, we have to check if an item was passed into the URL. The `/search` route can be called with or without items in the parameter, so our function will have to use an **if** statement. If there is items in the parameter, they will be contained in `req.query`. So we can use an if statement to check if that exists: 

```js
app.get('/search', function(req, res) { 
  if (req.query) { // If there are items in the URL
  	res.send(req.query)
  } else { // No items in the URL
  	console.log('do nothing')
  }
})
```

In the above, if there are items in the URL, we send it back to the user, and if not we just log to the user that we're doing nothing. The last thing we need to do is connect the file to a port by using the ``app.listen`` command.

```javascript
app.listen(3000)
```

Lets go to the terminal and run it:

```
nodemon query.js
```

Once it is up on the port, head over to the browser and type in:

```
http://localhost:3000/search?name=Eddy&Age=25
```

The result should look like:
