### Middleware

Middleware is any software that connects operating systems like Linux, Windows, and MacOS to communication protocols and applications that run on it. We have already encountered middleware in the form of APIs. They help tie seperate applications together by "translating" between them and can allow clients to access high level programs without understanding the entire complexity of the program. Middleware can be used to optimize already existing applications as well as help create new ones efficiently.

With express, middleware functions are used to execute code, change requests and response objects, and call more middleware functions.
