<!--title={What is Express?}-->

Express.js, more commonly known as **Express**,  is a popular web application framework, meaning people often use it to build web applications and APIs. 



An **Application Programming Interface (API)** is a set of functions and  procedures that allow applications to access the contents of another  developer's server. They let servers communicate with each other and transfer data securely back and forth.

Exposing source code to a third-party server is dangerous and could  compromise the entire server providing the access, so APIs allow  authentication keys to ensure safe transfer.



Express is the de facto standard server framework for **Node.js**. Essentially, Node.js is the JavaScript environment, and Express helps build the code so Node.js can execute the code. 



Express is **unopinionated**, meaning that the framework itself deosn't have a templated way of doing things. Frameworks that are opinionated force the user to do things a certain way, such as accessing data structures. Conversely, unopinionated frameworks trust the programmer to be correct. 



Below is an image for Node and Express. Angular.js is a frontend framework, and MongoDB is a backend framework. They both communicate with Express.js to run the server.
