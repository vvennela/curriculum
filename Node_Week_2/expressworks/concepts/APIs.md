<!--title={APIs}-->

Before we discuss what an API is, let's think back when you were a child and couldn't do much. Whenever you needed help with a task or had a question, you had to ask your parents for help. Your parents would help you complete the task or answer the question. What does this have to do with APIs? Well in this case we can say your parent is acting like the API between you, the client, making requests and your parent's knowledge, the database, responding with information. 

### What is an API?

A formal definition of an **Application Programming Interface (API)** is a set of functions and procedures that allow applications to access the contents of another developer's server or database. 

They allow for communication between servers and servers and servers and databases and transfer data securely back and forth. To protect a client's data, APIs allow authentication keys to ensure safe transfer to a third-party servers. 

A simplified way of thinking about APIs can be seen in basic Object Oriented Programming(OOP). In OOP, each class is isolated by file and has public functions and methods that interact with your other classes and objects. These public functions and methods are in essence APIs because they are allow your file to interact with other files.
