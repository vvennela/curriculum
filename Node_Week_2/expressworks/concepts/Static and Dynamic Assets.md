<!--title={Static Asset vs. Dynamic Assets}--> 

This concept card goes over the differences in **static** assets and **dynamic** assets. Both are used in websites,  delivering pages to users, but we'll go over the differences. 



**Static** assets are the same each time they are rendered to the user. HTML files are examples of static assets. One example that's similar to static assets are billboards - once they're plastered on a sign, they aren't changing.

In contrast, **dynamic** assets change specific to the user or some other variable. A dynamic page might change for different users dependent on things like location. A good example is time. Time *cannot* change on a static page, whereas in a dynamic page the time reflects the real world. Dynamic pages probably use URL parameters we talked about previously to render things dependent on the variable passed in. A profile page is a good example of how a variable passed into the URL can change what's displayed. 



For our billboard example, a dynamic billboard might be an digitized billboard, displaying a changing message or different ads, instead of one singular ad.
