<!--title={Introduction to Express}-->

Before we begin programming web applications, let's explore what Express is.



Firstly, **Express** is a popular web application framework, meaning people often use it to build web applications and APIs. What then, is an API?



An **Application Programming Interface (API)** is a set of functions and  procedures that allow applications to access the contents of another  developer's server. They let servers communicate with each other and transfer data securely back and forth.

Exposing source code to a third-party server is dangerous and could  compromise the entire server providing the access, so APIs allow  authentication keys to ensure safe transfer. 



Great! Let's define a few more simple terms that will be helpful to understand: 

* **Client** - The client of a server or website is the web browser viewing it. They  send http requests to the server under the assumption that the server is functioning well and will return the requested page based on the URL.

* **Endpoint** - An endpoint is the URL where your service can be accessed by a client application.

  If application A wants to reach application B's data stored in a page called data, they would send a GET request to `<Application B website URL>/data`
