<!--title={Hello World!}--> 

"Hello World!" is the text most students output as their first exercise in learning a programming language. We're going try that exercise in Express!



Your goal is to create an Express.js application that outputs "Hello World!" when somebody goes to `/home`. Have your application listen to port `3000`. Your application should be self-contained, meaning that it shouldn't have to import other items.  



The first step in our process is to install the Express module if you haven't done so already. 

```termi
$ npm install express --save
```

Great! Once we've installed that, we'll need to import the module into our file. Express uses the keyword `require()` for import notation. After that, we define our `app` using the express import call `express()`. 

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
```



Since all we've done is import express, we need to have our app actually perform an action. We will have our app use a GET when someone accesses the `/home` page to receive the request by taking in a function with a request `req` and a response `res`. 

```js
app.get('/home', function(req, res) { })
```

Now, let's have our function respond by saying 'Hello World.' `res.send()` means that we're sending as a response the argument of send. 

```js
app.get('/home', function(req, res) {
	res.send('Hello World!')
})
```

Lastly, add: 

```
app.listen(3000)
```

`app.listen(3000)` means that our function will listen to the port 3000 on our web browser. So when we enter **localhost:3000/home** into our web browser, our function will respond.

Great Job! All you have to do to run your server is go into the terminal and run: 

```
node YourFileName.js
```
