<!--title={Introduction to REST APIs}-->

In the previous card we defined an API. Now, let's explore what a REST API is. 

**REST** stands for **Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer, and it is a software architecture pattern that is useful because clients do not need to know anything about the applications before hand. 

REST APIs have operations that match four basic web operations (**CRUD**):

| CRUD                 | REST APIs | Meaning                           |
| -------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| **C**reate           | Post      | Creates data in server            |
| **R**ead (retrieve)  | Get       | Retrieves data from server        |
| **U**pdate (modify)  | Put       | Update and replace data in server |
| **D**elete (destroy) | Delete    | Delete data from server           |

We'll be using all four of the above operations!

Servers implement some form of REST API to allow http requests to carry through their routes and send back an appropriate status code. Looking at the diagram below, we can see that a client's http requests pass through a REST API to search through a database to extract what it needs for the request. 

REST APIs are the *black box* that clients utilize to browse the web
