<!--title={Proccessing Web Forms}-->

This exercise will be specifically talking how to process the traditional (non-AJAX) web form.

Our goal is to write a route (`'/form'`) that processes HTML form input
(`<form><input name="str"/></form>`) and responds with the value of `str` backwards.

To start lets name this file `forms.js` and include the `express` module in out program and create an instance:

```js
var express = require('express')
var app = express()
```

Express.js uses **middleware** to provide extra functionality to your web server. Middleware lies between an operating system and the applications running on it and enables communication and data management for distributed applications, providing a large variety of functionality such as logging, serving static files, and error handling.

Simply put, a middleware is a function invoked by Express.js before your own request handler.

In this program we are going to use the middleware `urlencoded()`  from the `body-parser` module. Let's import the  `body-parser` module just like we did for the `express` module:

```js
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
```

How can we access the middleware now that we imported the module? We call the `use()` function and pass the desired middleware as a parameter. Note that we do not have to process complex queries (inputs) so we can set extended as false.  

```js
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}))
```

Now that we have our middleware added, the next step is to handle POST requests. POST requests are like GET requests in the way  that it requests that a web server accepts data,  but instead of appending the variables to the URL string like with GET, POST sends data in the from of request message where the data is included in the body of the request. Here's an outline of the function we need to fill in:

```js
app.post('/form',function(req, res){
         //Fill this in!
})
```

We're almost done! Now we just have to output the backwards input string to the user. Remember, we use `res.send()` to send items back to the user. 

How about to reverse the string? We'll use `str` methods to split our input string character by character, reverse them then rejoin them together. Here we stored our result in a `var`:

```js
var reversedString = req.body.str.split('').reverse().join('')
```

Let's put it all together: 

```js
app.post('/form', function(req, res){
  var reversedString = req.body.str.split('').reverse().join('')
	res.send(reversedString)
})
```

Lastly, we just have to start the Express.js serve with `listen()` where the port number(where the server is started) is passed as a parameter. 

Our final code should look something like this:

```js
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
var app = express()

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}))

app.post('/form',fucntion(req, res){
  res.send(req.body.str.split('').reverse().join(''))
})

app.listen(3000)
```



Great job! 



To run your code properly, make sure the the `body-parser` module and is installed. 

```
node forms.js
```

If running the above doesn't work, try 

```
npm install body-parser
```



To access your route type in your browser:  

```
http://localhost:3000 
```

Congratulations! You finished the activity!
