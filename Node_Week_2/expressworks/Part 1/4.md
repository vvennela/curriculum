<!--title={Static Assets in Express}-->

In this activity, we'll be serving static assets like HTML files! **Static Assets** means file are the same for each individual user, and don't change once they are loaded. 



Your goal is to use the `express.static()` method to render the given static file to the user when `/home` is accessed. Copy and paste the following code, and name it `index.html`. Usually, static files are placed in a folder called **public**. Create this folder and place the `index.html` file into it. Finally, we'll have your application listen to **port 3000**.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>expressworks</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/main.css"/>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I am red!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

The first thing we'll need to do in our file is define our app, and import a new module:

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

const path = require('path')
```

In the above code, we're creating our app as we've done before, and also importing the path module.



Now, we need to tell our application the path to the `public` directory by usig the path module:

```js
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')))
```

Now that we have everything set up, we can tell our application to render the `index.html` file. 

```js
app.get('/home', function(req, res) {
  res.render(index.html)
})
```

The above is essentially saying that when the `/home` url is accessed in the web browser, we'll render the index.html file. 



Great job!
