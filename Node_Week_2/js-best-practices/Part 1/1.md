<!--title={Getting Started on the Best JavaScript Practices}--> 

Although oftentimes code will give the expected result, there's a large difference between readable code and sloppy code. Many computer science companies need multiple people working on the same segments of code, so it's logical that the code needs to be readable and separated into maintanable chunks so that if your code was to be given to another person to work on, they could easily pick it up through explanations. 



 Throughout this module, you'll learn best practices to help keep your code maintainable, as well 
as some bad practices to avoid. Here's an overview of the concepts we're going to cover:

* Basics
* Obsolete Practices
* Agile Engineering
* Third Party Libraries



Below is the code for a file you should name `vendingMachine.js`. Although the code works, you'll fix the code so that the code is much more maintanable and understandable. 

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var path = require('path');
var shop = require('../../js-best-practices');

module.exports = function buildExercise(){
  printProblem().then(function(){
    return waitForInput('press any key to continue...');
  }).then(function(){
    shop.execute(['init']);
  });
  
  return {
    noprint: true
  };
}

function waitForInput(prompt){
  return new Promise(function(res, rej){
    console.log(prompt);
    var alreadyRaw = process.stdin.isRaw;
    process.stdin.setRawMode(true);
    process.stdin.resume();
    process.stdin.once('data', function(){
      process.stdin.pause();
      process.stdin.setRawMode(alreadyRaw);
      res();
    });
  });
}

function printProblem(){
  return new Promise(function(res, rej){
    var lang = shop.i18n.lang()
    var problem = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'problem' + (lang === 'en' ? '' : '.' + lang) + '.md'));
    var stream = shop.createMarkdownStream({
      meta: {
        name: 'get started',
        number: 0
      }
    });
    stream.append(problem, 'md');
    stream.pipe(require('workshopper-adventure/lib/mseePipe')())
          .pipe(process.stdout)
    stream.on('end', res);
  });
}
```
