This may seem like a daunting task. Let's break it down.

Binary Search takes as arguments an array `arr` and three integers, `l`, `r`, and `x`. `l` is the leftmost index of the array we are searching and `r` is the rightmost index of the array we are searching.  `x` is the element we are looking for.

``` python
# Function call 
result = binarySearch(arr, 0, len(arr)-1, x) 
```

This is why the first function call passes in 0 for `l` and `len(arr) - 1` for `r` as we are searching the entire array, from index 0 to the array length minus 1. `l` and `r` will become important in the recursive calls made in the function. These values will track the section we search in the list of values, and can change with each recursive call of `binarySearch`. We will use recursion, that is, the function calling itself until a base case is met, in order to continuously cut the size of the array in half to more easily find our target value.

We start our binary search function by setting up a base case.

```python
def binarySearch (arr, l, r, x): 
  if r >= l: 
```

We only proceed with the algorithm if the right index is greater than a left index (`if r >= l`). When `r < l`, then we know that the element is not in the array, as the start of the array (represented by `l`) must always be before the end of the array (represented by `r`). 

If we pass this test, we find the index of the middle element using the formula:

```python
	mid = l + (r - l) / 2
```

This is analogous to the formula shown in the previous section:

```
	mid = low + (high - low) / 2
```

Note that the formula uses integer division, meaning that any decimal places are truncated. For example, 

```
	mid = 5 + (4-1) / 2 = 5 + 3/2 = 5 + 1 = 6
```

Note that the following `if`, `elif` and `else` statements are nested within the first `if r >= 1:` statement. 
We then proceed if the element we are looking for (`x`) is indeed the middle element. If this is the case, we have found the element and the algorithm returns the middle index and terminates. This is seen here:

```python
	if arr[mid] == x: 
			return mid 
```

If the target element's value is less than the middle element's value, that implies that the target element should be to the left of the middle element (remember, the array is sorted). This case is handled by the following `elif` statement.

````python
	elif arr[mid] > x: 
			return binarySearch(arr, l, mid-1, x) 
````

The body of the `elif` statement performs a recursive call to `binarySearch`, changing the right endpoint  (`r`) to `mid - 1`. This is done as we had determined that `x` must be on the left side of the array. The set of values we are now searching through are only those from indices `l` to `mid - 1`. By doing this recursive call, we have essentially split our problem in half.

Our else statement accounts for any case that the target element is not in the middle and it is not to the left, meaning it must be to the right of `mid` (and greater in value than the middle element's value).

```python
	else: 
		return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, r, x) 
```

The body of the `else` statement performs a recursive call to `binarySearch` in a similar way to the `elif` statement. The difference here is that we had determined that `x` must be on the right side of `mid` and thus would be contained between the indices `mid + 1` and `r`. By doing this recursive call, the problem is again split in half. 

This diagram shows how the recursive calls work in finding an element `x`.

The last case is reserved for when the element cannot be found. As stated earlier, this occurs when `r` < `l`.  In this case, we return `-1` to signify that we could not find `x`. This `else` is in reference to the first `if` statement, which was a checkpoint to perform the rest of the algorithm described above. When that first condition isn't met, we skip over all of that code and execute the code in this statement.

```python
	else: 
		return -1
```

When does `r < l` occur? To understand this, let's go back to our recursive calls

```python
		elif arr[mid] > x: 
			return binarySearch(arr, l, mid-1, x) 
      
		else: 
			return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, r, x) 
```

In the first possible recursive call, we decrement `mid` and pass it to the argument `r`, without changing `l`. In the second possible recursive call, we increment `mid` and pass it to the argument `l`, without changing `r`. One can see that if the target element is not in between `l` and `r` everytime we shrink the size of the array (by adjusting `l` and `r`), eventually, we could have `l` cross (be greater than) `r` (either by passing in `mid - 1` for `r` or `mid + 1` for `l`).

Here is how the algorithm would proceed when you are unable to find an element:

Finally, we have the complete binary search algorithm coded in Python:

```python
# Python Program for recursive binary search. 

# Returns index of x in arr if present, else -1 
def binarySearch (arr, l, r, x): 

	# Check base case 
	if r >= l: 

		mid = l + (r - l)/2

		# If element is present at the middle itself 
		if arr[mid] == x: 
			return mid 
		
		# If element is smaller than mid, then it 
		# can only be present in left subarray 
		elif arr[mid] > x: 
			return binarySearch(arr, l, mid-1, x) 

		# Else the element can only be present 
		# in right subarray 
		else: 
			return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, r, x) 

	else: 
		# Element is not present in the array 
		return -1

# test your code!
```

This block of code is what we use to test if our function is working properly. Feel free to twink with it. 

```python
arr = [ 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 ] 
x = 10

# Function call 
result = binarySearch(arr, 0, len(arr)-1, x) 

if result != -1: 
	print "Element is present at index % d" % result 
else: 
	print "Element is not present in array"
```
