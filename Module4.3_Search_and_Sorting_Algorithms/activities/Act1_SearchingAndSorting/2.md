**Implementing Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

This code is used to test our BFS algorithm. Let's see what each step does.

```python
g = Graph() 
g.addEdge(0, 1) 
g.addEdge(0, 2) 
g.addEdge(1, 2) 
g.addEdge(2, 0) 
g.addEdge(2, 3) 
g.addEdge(3, 3) 

print ("Following is Breadth First Traversal"
				" (starting from vertex 2)") 
g.BFS(2) 
```


We first construct an empty Graph object. This is what we will traverse using the BFS function.

```python
g = Graph()
```

We then add edges between our vertices as we build our graph.

```python
g.addEdge(0, 1) 
g.addEdge(0, 2) 
g.addEdge(1, 2) 
g.addEdge(2, 0) 
g.addEdge(2, 3) 
g.addEdge(3, 3)
```
A visual representation of this code would look like this:

Finally, we call our BFS function on our newly constructed graph, starting at vertex 2. This will print out the order in which the vertices were visited by our BFS algorithm.

```python
print ("Following is Breadth First Traversal"
				" (starting from vertex 2)") 
g.BFS(2)
```
We've learned how to build a graph by adding edges between its vertices and print out a BFS traversal of our graph, but how is the BFS internally implemented?

The first step in implementing the BFS algorithm is to create a Graph class.

```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Graph: 

	def __init__(self): 		
		self.graph = defaultdict(list)
```

Naturally, a `Graph` object should have an `addEdge` function, so that vertices can be connected to one another.

```python
def addEdge(self,u,v): 
	self.graph[u].append(v)  
```
The `addEdge` function takes as arguments the two vertices of the graph that you wish to connect (`u` and `v`). `self.graph[u].append(v)` takes the vertex `u` and adds (through `append`) the vertex `v` to the list of vertices that are adjacent to `u`. This means that the graph has an edge from `u` to `v`! 

The following is a visual representation of these adjacency lists:

Now we add the `BFS` function to our class. The `BFS` function takes the vertex from which we are to start our search (`s`) as an argument. Here is the code for the BFS algorithm. Let's break each step down, line-by-line.


```python
def BFS(self, s):
```
`visited` is an array that keeps track of the vertices that have already been visited (marked `True` when visited). We initialize this  to `False` for every vertex, as at the start of the algorithm, no vertices have been visited yet.

```python
visited = [False] * (len(self.graph)) 
```


We need a queue (recall the First-In, First Out rule) for the order in which the vertices are visited. Since no vertices have been visited yet, we initalize the queue to be empty.


``` python
queue = []
```

Before we get into the meat of the algorithm, skim this diagram. As you read the implementation details, continue to refer back to this diagram to check your understanding.

To begin the search, we insert the start node (`s`) into the queue and mark `s` as visited by changing `visited[s]` to `True`.


```python
queue.enqueue(s) 
visited[s] = True
```

We want the algorithm to end once the queue is empty, as this signifies that all of the nodes of the graph have been visited. As a result, we give the condition `while queue` (i.e. run the body of the loop while the queue still has an element in it).

```python
		while queue:  
			s = queue.dequeue() 
			print (s, end = " ") 	
```

The first step of the `while` loop is to dequeue the first element, which means we remove the first element from the queue.

```python
s = queue.dequeue()
```

Initially, we had only pushed the start node (argument `s`) into the queue, so at this point, it will be removed and stored in `s`, which now serves as a temporary variable for storing the last dequeued vertex.

We then print the element to the console. The order in which the elements will be printed to the console will indicated the order in which they were visited in the BFS algorithm.

```python
print (s, end = " ") 
```

Now, we must check which of the adjacent vertices of `s` (the last vertex dequeued from the queue) have been visited. If the adjacent vertices have not been visited, we add them to our queue and mark them as visited. This is done for through the following `for` loop. Once again, let's break down each line.

```python
			for i in self.graph[s]: 
				if visited[i] == False: 
					queue.enqueue(i) 
					visited[i] = True
```

 The `for` loop header runs for every vertex adjacent to (i.e. has an edge to) the last vertex popped from the queue (`s`). It accesses the adjacent vertices with `self.graph` from the constructor method, using `[s]` to indicate where to start from.

```python
for i in self.graph[s]:
```

In the body of the for loop, `i` represents the current adjacent (to `s`) vertex we are observing. We then refer to the `visited` array and check if the vertex has already been visited.

```python
if visited[i] == False: 
```

 If `i` has already been visited (`visited[i] == True`) we should return to the top of the `for` loop and continue the algorithm with the next vertex adjacent to `s`. However, if the element has not been visited (`visited[i] == False`), we will have to perform additional work in order to ensure the element is recognized as visited.

First, we must add `i` to the queue. This is so that we can process the neighbors of `i` when we dequeue it later in the algorithm. 

```python
queue.enqueue(i)
```

 We also must change the value of `i` in `visited` to `True`, so that for the rest of the algorithm, it is known that this vertex has been visited.

```python
visited[i] = True
```

After all the adjacent vertices of `s` are processed in the `for` loop, we jump back to the top of `while` loop and check if the queue still has vertices in it (`while queue`). If the queue is empty, the algorithm terminates as we have visited (and printed to the console) all the vertices in BFS order. Otherwise, we pop the first element from the queue and repeat the procedure until all vertices have been visited.

Now we put everything together and we get the following:

```python
def BFS(self, s): 
  visited = [False] * (len(self.graph)) 
  queue = [] 
  queue.append(s) 
  visited[s] = True
  while queue:  
	s = queue.pop(0) 
	print (s, end = " ")
        for i in self.graph[s]: 
		if visited[i] == False: 
			queue.append(i) 
			visited[i] = True
```

And thats the implementation of the BFS algorithm! The following diagram may also help you visualize the process:

Next, we will explore Depth First Searches (DFS).
