**The Importance of Searching**

Searching is the process of finding an element in a data structure, and in computer science, there are many different kinds of sorting, such as linear search, binary search, depth-first search, breadth-first search, and so on. We will be explaining these searching methods in more depth in this activity, and we will start with breadth-first search below! Searching is a key concept in computer science—the applications are endless! 

Suppose, for example, I love watching movies. I have collections of all of the *Harry Potter*, *The Lord of the Rings*, and *James Bond* films. I have invited some friends to binge-watch them with me tomorrow morning, but I woke up late and need to find the movies quickly! How can I find the movies that I want to watch in the most efficient manner possible, before the doorbell rings?

Now extend this problem to wide-scale computer systems. What if we needed to find certain information (say, for example, medical records) from stored data in a timely fashion? What sort of algorithms should we implement? Luckily, Computer Scientists have developed answers for us!



**The Importance of Graphs**

A graph in computer science is a visual representation of a set of nodes that are connected together by edges, and graphs allow us to view information and relationships in data structures in a way that is easier to read and understand!

What can we do with graphs? Graph traversal, or graph search, is the process of visiting each vertex in a graph. This is important because, as we traverse through a graph, we can change or update each vertex that is visited, which can be very useful!

How can we store graphs? Graphs can be stored in lists and matrices, and for instance, the two most commonly-used methods to store a graph are in an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix. An adjacency list is an array that notes each node with the vertices that are directly connected, or adjacent, to it by an edge, and an adjacency matrix is a matrix that notes which nodes are adjacent to each other with a "1" (if the nodes are not adjacent, then this is noted by a "0").



**Breadth-first search (BFS)**

Now that we have learned about the importance of searching and graphs, let's start learning more about different kinds of searching algorithms, starting with Breadth-first search (BFS)!

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

As in the example given above, BFS algorithm starts at S, traverses to A, B, and C (the first layer), then traverses to D, E, and F (second layer), and then finally to G (third layer). More formally, BFS employs the following rules.

- **Rule 1** − Visit the adjacent unvisited vertex. Mark it as visited. Display it. Insert it in a queue.
- **Rule 2** − If no adjacent vertex is found, remove the first vertex from the queue.
- **Rule 3** − Repeat Rule 1 and Rule 2 until the queue is empty.
